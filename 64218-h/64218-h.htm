<h2>A JOURNEY, &amp;c.</h2>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="FRIBURG" id="FRIBURG">FRIBURG</a></h3>

<p>Is an antient Imperial city and the
capital of the Brisgau. Its name alludes to
the privileges granted to such cities; but its
present condition, like that of many others,
is a proof of the virtual discontinuance of
the rights, by which the Sovereign intended
to invite to one part of his dominions the
advantages of commerce. Its appearance is
that, which we have so often described;
better than Cologne, and worse than Mentz;
its size is about a third part of the latter
city. On descending to it, the first distinct
object is the spire of the great church, a
remarkable structure, the stones of which
are laid with open interstices, so that the
light appears through its tapering sides. Of
this sort of stone fillagree work there are
said to be other specimens in Germany.
The city was once strongly fortified, and
has endured some celebrated sieges. In
1677, 1713, and 1745 it was taken by the
French, who, in the latter year, destroyed
all the fortifications, which had rendered it
formidable, and left nothing but the present
walls.</p>

<p>Being, however, a frontier place towards
Switzerland, it is provided with a small
Austrian garrison; and the business of permitting,
or preventing the passage of travellers
into that country is entrusted to its
officers. The malignity, or ignorance of
one of these, called the Lieutenant de Place,
prevented us from reaching it, after a journey
of more than six hundred miles; a
disappointment, which no person could bear
without severe regret, but which was alloyed
to us by the reports we daily heard of
some approaching change in Switzerland
unfavourable to England, and by a consciousness
of the deduction which, in spite
of all endeavours at abstraction, encroachments
upon physical comfort and upon the
assurance of peacefulness make from the disposition
to enquiry, or fancy.</p>

<p>We had delivered at the gate the German
passport, recommended to us by M. de
Schwartzkoff, and which had been signed
by the Commandant at Mentz; the man,
who took it, promising to bring it properly
attested to our inn. He returned without
the passport, and, as we afterwards found,
carried our voiturier to be examined by an
officer. We endeavoured in vain to obtain
an explanation, as to this delay and appearance
of suspicion, till, at supper, the Lieutenant
de Place announced himself, and presently
shewed, that he was not come to offer
apologies. This, man, an illiterate Piedmontese
in the Austrian service, either believed,
or affected to do so, that our name
was not Radcliffe, but something like it,
with a German termination, and that we
were not English, but Germans. Neither
my Lord Grenville's, or M. de Schwartzkoff's
passports, our letters from London
to families in Switzerland, nor one of credit
from the Messrs. Hopes of Amsterdam to
the Banking-house of Porta at Lausanne,
all of which he pretended to examine, could
remove this discerning suspicion as to our
country. While we were considering, as
much as vexation would permit, what circumstance
could have afforded a pretext for
any part of this intrusion, it came out incidentally,
that the confirmation given to
our passport at Mentz, which we had never
examined, expressed "returning to England,"
though the pass itself was for Basil,
to which place we were upon our route.</p>

<p>Such a contradiction might certainly
have justified some delay, if we had not
been enabled to prove it accidental to the
satisfaction of any person desirous of being
right. The passport had been produced at
Mentz, together with those of two English
artists, then on their return from Rome,
whom we had the pleasure to see at Franckfort.
The Secretary inscribed all the passports
alike of England, and M. de Lucadou,
the Commandant, hastily signed ours,
without observing the mistake, though he
so well knew us to be upon the road to
Switzerland, that he politely endeavoured
to render us some service there. Our friends
in Mentz being known to him, he desired
us to accept an address from himself to M.
de Wilde, Intendant of salt mines near Bec.
We produced to Mr. Lieutenant this address,
as a proof, that the Commandant both
knew us, and where we were going; but
it soon appeared, that, though the former
might have honestly fallen into his suspicions
at first, he had a malignant obstinacy
in refusing to abandon them. He left us,
with notice that we could not quit the town
without receiving the Commandant's permission
by his means; and it was with
some terror, that we perceived ourselves to
be so much in his power, in a place where
there was a pretext for military authority,
and where the least expression of just indignation
seemed to provoke a disposition for
further injustice.</p>

<p>The only relief, which could be hinted to
us, was to write to the Commandant at
Mentz, who might re-testify his knowledge
of our destination; yet, as an answer
could not be received in less than eight
days, and, as imagination suggested not only
all the possible horrors of oppression, during
that period, but all the contrivances, by
which the malignant disposition we had
already experienced, might even then be
prevented from disappointment, we looked
upon this resource as little better than the
worst, and resolved in the morning to demand
leave for an immediate return to
Mentz.</p>

<p>There being then some witnesses to the
application, the Lieutenant conducted himself
with more propriety, and even proposed
an introduction to the Commandant, to
whom we could not before hear of any
direct means of access; there being a possibility,
he said, that a passage into Switzerland
might be permitted. But the disgust
of Austrian authority was now so complete,
that we were not disposed to risk the mockery
of an appeal. The Lieutenant expressed
his readiness to allow our passage, if we
should choose to return from Mentz with
another passport; but we had no intention
to be ever again in his power, and, assuring
him that we should not return, left Friburg
without the hope of penetrating through the
experienced, and present difficulties of Germany,
into the far-seen delights of Switzerland.</p>

<p>As those, who leave one home for another,
think, in the first part of their journey,
of the friends they have left, and, in the
last, of those, to whom they are going; so
we, in quitting the borders of Switzerland,
thought only of that country; and, when
we regained the eminence from whence the
tops of its mountains had been so lately
viewed with enthusiastic hope, all this delightful
expectation occurred again to the
mind, only to torture it with the certainty
of our loss; but, as the distance from Switzerland
increased, the attractions of home
gathered strength, and the inconveniences
of Germany, which had been so readily felt
before, could scarcely be noticed when we
knew them to lie in the road to England.</p>

<p>We passed Offenburg, on the first day of
our return, and, travelling till midnight, as
is customary in Germany during the summer,
traversed the unusual space of fifty
miles in fourteen hours. Soon after passing
Appenweyer we overtook the rear-guard of
the army, the advanced party of which we
had met at that place three nights before.
The troops were then quartered in the villages
near the road, and their narrow waggons
were sometimes drawn up on both
sides of it. They had probably but lately
separated, for there were parties of French
ladies and gentlemen, who seemed to have
taken the benefit of moon-light to be spectators,
and some of the glow-worms, that had
been numerous on the banks, now glittered
very prettily in the hair of the former.</p>

<p>At Biel, a small town, which we reached
about midnight, the street was rendered
nearly impassable by military carriages, and
we were surprised to find, that every room
in the inn was not occupied by troops; but
one must have been very fastidious to have
complained of any part of our reception
here. As to lodging, though the apartment
was as bare as is usual in Germany, there
was the inscription of "Chambre de Monsieur"
over the door, and on another near
it "Chambre de Cond&eacute; le Grand"; personages,
who, it appeared, had once been accommodated
there, for the honour of which
the landlord chose to retain their inscriptions.
Their meeting here was probably in
1791, soon after the departure of the former
from France.</p>

<p>The second day's journey brought us
again to Schwetzingen, from whence we
hoped to have reached Manheim, that
night; but the post horses were all out, and
none others could be hired, the village being
obliged to furnish a certain number for the
carriage of stores to the Austrian army.
Eighteen of these we had met, an hour before,
drawing slowly in one waggon, laden
with cannon balls. We stayed the following
day at Manheim, and, on the next,
reached Mentz, where our statement of the
obstruction at Friburg excited less surprise
than indignation, the want of agreement
between the Austrian and Prussian officers
being such, that the former, who are frequently
persons of the lowest education, are
said to neglect no opportunity of preying
upon accidental mistakes in passports, or
other business, committed by the Prussians.
Before our departure we were, however,
assured, that a proper representation of the
affair had been sent by the first estaffette to
the Commandant at Friburg.</p>

<p>Further intelligence of the course of
affairs in Flanders, was now made known in
Germany; and our regrets, relative to Switzerland,
were lessened by the apparent probability,
that a return homeward might in
a few months be rendered difficult by some
still more unfortunate events to the allies.
Several effects of the late reverses and symptoms
of the general alarm were indeed already
apparent at Mentz. Our inn was
filled with refugees not only from Flanders,
but from Liege, which the French had not
then threatened. Some of the emigrants of
the latter nation, in quitting the places
where they had temporarily settled, abandoned
their only means of livelihood, and
several parties arrived in a state almost too
distressful to be repeated. Ladies and children,
who had passed the night in fields,
came with so little property, and so little
appearance of any, that they were refused
admittance at many inns; for some others,
it seemed, after resting a day or two, could
offer only tears and lamentations, instead of
payment. Our good landlord, Philip Bolz,
relieved several, and others had a little charity
from individuals; but, as far as we saw
and heard, the Germans very seldom afforded
them even the consolations of compassion
and tender manners.</p>

<p>Mentz is the usual place of embarkment
for a voyage down the Rhine, the celebrated
scenery of whose banks we determined to
view, as some compensation for the loss of
Switzerland. We were also glad to escape
a repetition of the fatigues of travel by
land, now that these were to be attended
with the uncertainties occasioned by any unusual
influx of travellers upon the roads.</p>

<p>The business of supplying post-horses is
here not the private undertaking of the
innkeepers; so that the emulation and civility,
which might be excited by their views
of profit, are entirely wanting. The Prince
de la Tour Taxis is the Hereditary Grand
Post-master of the Empire, an office, which
has raised his family from the station of
private Counts, to a seat in the College of
Princes. He has a monopoly of the profits
arising from this concern, for which he is
obliged to forward all the Imperial packets
gratis. A settled number of horses and a
post-master are kept at every stage; where
the arms of the Prince, and some line entreating
a blessing upon the post, distinguish
the door of his office. The post-master
determines, according to the number of
travellers and the quantity of baggage, how
many horses must be hired; three persons
cannot be allowed to proceed with less than
three horses, and he will generally endeavour
to send out as many horses as there
are persons.</p>

<p>The price for each horse was established
at one florin, or twenty pence per post, but,
on account of the war, a florin and an
half is now paid; half a florin is also due
for the carriage; and the postillion is entitled
to a trinkgeld, or drink-money, of another
half florin; but, unless he is promised
more than this at the beginning of the stage,
he will proceed only at the regulated pace
of four hours for each post, which may be
reckoned at ten or twelve English miles.
We soon learned the way of quickening
him, and, in the Palatinate and the Brisgau,
where the roads are good, could proceed
nearly as fast as we wished, amounting
to about five miles an hour.</p>

<p>If the post-master supplies a carriage, he
demands half a florin per stage for it; but
the whole expence of a chaise and two
horses, including the tolls and the <i>trinkgeld</i>,
which word the postillions accommodate to
English ears by pronouncing it <i>drinkhealth</i>,
does not exceed eight pence per mile. We
are, however, to caution all persons against
supposing, as we did, that the chaises of the
post must be proper ones, and that the necessity
of buying a carriage, which may be
urged to them, is merely that of shew;
these chaises are more inconvenient and
filthy, than any travelling carriage, seen in
England, can give an idea of, and a stranger
should not enter Germany, before he has
purchased a carriage, which will probably
cost twenty pounds in Holland and sell for
fifteen, at his return. Having neglected
this, we escaped from the <i>chaises de poste</i>
as often as possible, by hiring those of voituriers,
whose price is about half as much
again as that of the post.</p>

<p>The regular drivers wear a sort of uniform,
consisting of a yellow coat, with black
cuffs and cape, a small bugle horn, slung
over the shoulders, and a yellow sash. At
the entrance of towns and narrow passes,
they sometimes sound the horn, playing
upon it a perfect and not unpleasant tune,
the music of their order. All other carriages
give way to theirs, and persons travelling
with them are considered to be under
the protection of the Empire; so that,
if they were robbed, information would be
forwarded from one post-house to another
throughout all Germany, and it would
become a common cause to detect the
aggressors. On this account, and because
there can be no concealment in a country
so little populous, highway robberies are
almost unknown in it, and the fear of them
is never mentioned. The Germans, who,
in summer, travel chiefly by night, are seldom
armed, and are so far from thinking
even watchfulness necessary, that most of
their carriages, though open in front, during
the day-time, are contrived with curtains
and benches, in order to promote rest. The
post-masters also assure you, that, if there
were robbers, they would content themselves
with attacking private voituriers,
without violating the sacredness of the post;
and the security of the postillions is so
strictly attended to, that no man dare strike
them, while they have the yellow coat on.
In disputes with their passengers they have,
therefore, sometimes been known to put off
this coat, in order to shew, that they do not
claim the extraordinary protection of the
laws.</p>

<p>These postillions acknowledge no obligation
to travellers, who usually give double
what can be demanded, and seem to consider
them only as so many bales of goods,
which they are under a contract with the
post-master to deliver at a certain place and
within a certain time. Knowing, that their
slowness, if there is no addition to their
<i>trinkgeld</i>, is of itself sufficient to compel
some gratuity, they do not depart from the
German luxury of incivility, and frequently
return no answer, when they are questioned,
as to distance, or desired to call the
servant of an inn, or to quit the worst part
of a road. When you tell them, that they
shall have a good <i>drinkhealth</i> for speed, they
reply, "Yaw, yaw;" and, after that, think
it unnecessary to reply to any enquiry till
they ask you for the money at the end of
a stage. They are all provided with tobacco
boxes and combustible bark, on which they
stop to strike with a flint and steel, immediately
after leaving their town; in the
hottest day and on the most dusty road,
they will begin to smoke, though every
whiff flies into the faces of the passengers
behind; and it must be some very positive
interference, that prevents them from continuing
it.</p>

<p>As long as there are horses not engaged
at any post-house, the people are bound to
supply travellers, within half an hour after
their arrival; but all the German Princes
and many of their Ministers are permitted
to engage the whole stock on the
road they intend to pass; and it frequently
happens, that individuals may be detained
a day, or even two, by such an order, if
there should be no voiturier to furnish them
with others. At Cologne and Bonn, when
we were first there, all the horses were ordered
for the Emperor, who passed through,
however, with only one carriage, accompanied
by an Aide-de-camp and followed
by two servants, on horseback. It happens
also frequently, that a sudden throng of
private travellers has employed the whole
stock of the post-masters; and the present
emigrations from Liege and Juliers, we
were assured, had filled the roads so much,
that we might be frequently detained in
small towns, and should find even the best
overwhelmed with crowds of fugitives.</p>

<p>During a stay of five days at Mentz,
we often wandered amidst the ruins of the
late siege, especially on the site of the
Favorita, from whence the majestic Rhine
is seen rolling from one chain of mountains
to another. Near this spot, and not less
fortunately situated, stood a Carthusian convent,
known in English history for having
been the head-quarters of George the Second,
in the year 1743, soon after the battle
of Dettingen. The apartments, used by
this monarch, were preserved in the state,
in which he left them, till a short time before
the late siege, when the whole building
was demolished, so that scarcely a trace of
it now remains.</p>

<p>By our enquiries for a passage vessel we
discovered the unpleasant truth, that the
dread of another invasion began now to
be felt at Mentz, where, a fortnight before,
not a symptom of it was discernible.
Several of the inhabitants had hired boats
to be in readiness for transporting their
effects to Franckfort, if the French should
approach much nearer to the Rhine; and
our friends, when we mentioned the circumstance,
confessed, that they were preparing
for a removal to Saxony. The state
of the arsenal had been lately enquired into,
and a deficiency, which was whispered to
have been discovered in the gunpowder,
was imputed to the want of cordiality between
the Austrians and Prussians, of whom
the latter, being uncertain that they should
stay in the place, had refused to replenish
the stores, at their own expence, and the
former would not spare their ammunition,
till the departure of the Prussians should
leave it to be guarded by themselves. The
communication with the other shore of the
Rhine, by the bridge and the fortifications
of Cassel, secured, however, to a German
garrison the opportunity of receiving supplies,
even if the French should occupy all
the western bank of the river.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="Voyage_down_the_Rhine" id="Voyage_down_the_Rhine">VOYAGE <span class="smallcaps">down the</span> RHINE.</a></h3>

<p>The boats, to be hired at Mentz,
are awkward imitations of the Dutch trechtschuyts,
or what, upon the Thames, would
be called House-boats; but, for the sake of
being allowed to dispose of one as the varieties
of the voyage should seem to tempt,
we gave four louis for the use of a cabin,
between Mentz and Cologne; the boatmen
being permitted to take passengers in the
other part of the vessel. In this we embarked
at six o'clock, on a delightful morning
in the latter end of July, and, as we
left the shore, had leisure to observe the
city in a new point of view, the most picturesque
we had seen. Its principal features
were the high quays called the Rheinstrasse,
the castellated palace, with its gothic
turrets, of pale red stone, the arsenal, the
lofty ramparts, far extended along the river,
and the northern gate; the long bridge of
boats completed the fore-ground, and some
forest hills the picture.</p>

<p>We soon passed the wooded island, called
<i>Peters-au</i>, of so much consequence, during
the siege, for its command of the bridge;
and, approaching the mountains of the
Rheingau to the north, the most sublime
in this horizon, saw their summits veiled in
clouds, while the sun soon melted the mists,
that dimmed their lower sides, and brought
out their various colouring of wood, corn
and soils. It was, however, nearly two
hours before the windings of the Rhine
permitted us to reach any of their bases.
Meanwhile the river flowed through highly
cultivated plains, chiefly of corn, with villages
thickly scattered on its banks, in which
are the country houses of the richer inhabitants
of Mentz, among pleasant orchards
and vineyards. Those on the right bank
are in the dominions of the Prince of
Nassau Usingen, who has a large chateau
in the midst of them, once tenanted, for a
night, by George the Second, and the Duke
of Cumberland.</p>

<p>The Rhine is here, and for several
leagues downward, of a very noble breadth,
perhaps wider than in any other part of
its German course; and its surface is animated
by many islands covered with poplars
and low wood. The western shore,
often fringed with pine and elms, is flat;
but the eastern begins to swell into hillocks
near Wallauf, the last village of Nassau
Usingen, and once somewhat fortified.</p>

<p>Here the <i>Rheingau</i>, or the country of
the vines, commences, and we approached
the northern mountains, which rise on the
right in fine sweeping undulations. These
increased in dignity as we advanced, and
their summits then appeared to be darkened
with heath and woods, which form part of
the extensive forest of <i>Landeswald</i>, or,
<i>Woodland</i>. Hitherto the scenery had been
open and pleasant only, but now the eastern
shore began to be romantic, starting into
heights, so abrupt, that the vineyards almost
overhung the river, and opening to
forest glens, among the mountains. Still,
however, towns and villages perpetually occurred,
and the banks of the river were
populous, though not a vessel besides our
own appeared upon it.</p>

<p>On the eastern margin are two small
towns, Ober- and Nieder-Ingelheim, which,
in the midst of the dominions of Mentz,
belong to the Elector Palatine. On this
shore also is made one of the celebrated
wines of the Rhine, called Markerbrunner,
which ranks next to those of Johannesberg
and Hockheim. At no great distance on
the same shore, but beneath a bank somewhat
more abrupt, is the former of these
places, alienated in the sixteenth century
from the dominions of Mentz, to those of
the Abbot, now Prince Bishop of Fulde.</p>

<p>The wine of the neighbouring steeps is
the highest priced of all the numerous sorts
of Rhenish; a bottle selling upon the spot,
where it is least likely to be pure, for three,
four, or five shillings, according to the vintages,
the merits and distinctions of which
are in the memory of almost every German.
That of 1786 was the most celebrated since
1779; but we continually heard that the
heat of 1794 would render this year equal
in fame to any of the others.</p>

<p>Behind the village is the large and well-built
abbey of Johannesberg, rich with all
this produce, for the security of which
there are immense cellars, cut in the rock
below, said to be capable of containing several
thousand tons of wine. The abbey
was founded in 1105; and there is a long
history of changes pertaining to it, till it
came into the possession of the Abbot of
Fulde, who rebuilt it in its present state.
This part of the Rheingau is, indeed, thickly
set with similar edifices, having, in a
short space, the nunnery of Marienthal,
and the monasteries of Nothgottes, Aulenhausen,
and Eibingen.</p>

<p>Further on is the large modern chateau
of Count Ostein, a nobleman of great
wealth, and, as it appears, of not less taste.
Having disposed all his nearer grounds in
a style for the most part English, he has
had recourse to the ridge of precipices, that
rise over the river, for sublimity and grandeur
of prospect. On the brink of these
woody heights, several pavilions have been
erected, from the most conspicuous of which
Coblentz, it is said, may be distinguished,
at the distance of forty miles. The view
must be astonishingly grand, for to the
south-east the eye overlooks all the fine
country of the Rheingau to Mentz; to the
west, the course of the Moselle towards
France; and, to the north, the chaos of
wild mountains, that screen the Rhine in
its progress to Coblentz.</p>

<p>So general was the alarm of invasion,
that Count Ostein had already withdrawn
into the interior of Germany, and was endeavouring
to dispose of this charming residence,
partly protected as it is by the
river, at the very disadvantageous price now
paid for estates on the western frontier of
the Empire.</p>

<p>The vineyards, that succeed, are proofs
of the industry and skill to which the Germans
are accustomed in this part of their
labours, the scanty soil being prevented from
falling down the almost perpendicular rocks,
by walls that frequently require some new
toil from the careful farmer. Every addition,
made to the mould, must be carried
in baskets up the steep paths, or rather
stair-cases, cut in the solid rock. At the
time of the vintage, when these precipices
are thronged with people, and the sounds
of merriment are echoed along them, the
spectacle must here be as striking and gay
as can be painted by fancy.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="BINGEN" id="BINGEN">BINGEN.</a></h3>

<p>About eleven o'clock, we reached
Bingen, a town of which the antiquity is
so clear, that one of its gates is still called
Drusithor, or, the gate of Drusus. Its appearance,
however, is neither rendered venerable
by age, or neat by novelty. The
present buildings were all raised in the distress
and confusion produced in 1689, after
Louis the Fourteenth had blown up the
fortifications, that endured a tedious siege in
the beginning of the century, and had destroyed
the city, in which Drusus is said to
have died.</p>

<p>It has now the appearance, which we
have often mentioned is characteristic of
most German towns, nearly every house
being covered with symptoms of decay and
neglect, and the streets abandoned to a few
idle passengers. Yet Bingen has the advantage
of standing at the conflux of two
rivers, the Nahe making there its junction
with the Rhine; and an antient German
book mentions it as the central place of an
hundred villages, or chateaux, the inhabitants
of which might come to its market
and return between sun-rise and sun-set.</p>

<p>Since the revolution in France, it has
occasionally been much the residence of
emigrants; and, in a plain behind the town,
which was pointed out to us, the King of
Prussia reviewed their army before the entrance
into France in 1792. A part of his
speech was repeated to us by a gentleman
who bore a high commission in it; "Gentlemen,
be tranquil and happy; in a little
time I shall conduct you to your homes and
your property."</p>

<p>Our companion, as he remembered the
hopes excited by this speech, was deeply
affected; an emigrant officer, of whom, as
well as of an Ex-Nobleman of the same
nation, with the latter of whom we parted
here, we must pause to say, that had the
old system in France, oppressive as it was,
and injurious as Englishmen were once
justly taught to believe it, been universally
administered by men of their mildness, integrity
and benevolence, it could not have
been entirely overthrown by all the theories,
or all the eloquence in the world.</p>

<p>Soon after this review, the march commenced;
the general effect of which it is
unnecessary to repeat. When the retreat
was ordered, the emigrant army, comprising
seventy squadrons of cavalry, was declared
by the King of Prussia to be disbanded, and
not any person was allowed to retain an
horse, or arms. No other purchasers were
present but the Prussians, and, in consequence
of this order, the finest horses, many
of which had cost forty louis each, were
now sold for four or five, some even for
one! It resulted accidentally, no doubt,
from this measure, that the Prussian army
was thus reprovided with horses almost as
cheaply as if they had seized them from
Dumourier.</p>

<p>Bingen was taken by the French in the
latter end of the campaign of 1792, and
was then nearly the northernmost of their
posts on the Rhine. It was regained by
the Prussians in their advances to Mentz,
at the commencement of the next campaign,
and has since occasionally served
them as a dep&ocirc;t of stores.</p>

<p>This town, seated on the low western
margin, surrounded with its old walls, and
overtopped by its ruined castle, harmonizes
well with the gloomy grandeur near it;
and here the aspect of the country changes
to a character awfully wild. The Rhine,
after expanding to a great breadth, at its
conflux with the Nahe, suddenly contracts
itself, and winds with an abrupt and rapid
sweep among the dark and tremendous
rocks, that close the perspective. Then,
disappearing beyond them, it leaves the
imagination to paint the dangers of its
course. Near the entrance of this close pass,
stands the town of Bingen, immediately opposite
to which appear the ruins of the
castle of Ehrenfels, on a cliff highly elevated
above the water, broken, craggy and impending,
but with vines crawling in narrow
crevices, and other rocks still aspiring
above it. On an island between these
shores, is a third ruined castle, very antient,
and of which little more than one tower
remains. This is called Mausthurm, or,
The Tower of the Rats, from a marvellous
tradition, that, in the tenth century, an
Archbishop Statto was devoured there by
these animals, after many cruelties to the
poor, whom he called Rats, that eat the
bread of the rich.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="EHRENFELS" id="EHRENFELS">EHRENFELS.</a></h3>

<p>Ehrenfels is synonymous to Majestic,
or Noble Rock; and Fels, which is
the present term for rock in all the northern
counties of England, as well as in Germany,
is among several instances of exact similarity,
as there are many of resemblance, between
the present British and German languages.
A German of the southern districts,
meaning to enquire what you would
have, says, "<i>Was woll zu haben?</i>" and in
the north there is a sort of Patois, called
<i>Plat Deutsche</i>, which brings the words
much nearer to our own. In both parts the
accent, or rather tone, is that, which prevails
in Scotland and the adjoining counties
of England. To express a temperate approbation
of what they hear, the Germans
say, "So&mdash;so;" pronouncing the words
slowly and long; exactly as our brethren
of Scotland would. In a printed narrative
of the siege of Mentz there is this passage,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">"<i>Funfzehn hundert menschen, meistens weiber
und kinder &hellip; wanderten mit dem
bundel under dem arm uber die brucke</i>;"&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fifteen
hundred persons, mostly wives and
children, wandered, with their bundles under
their arms, upon the bridge. So permanent
has been the influence over our
language, which the Saxons acquired by
their establishment of more than five centuries
amongst us; exiling the antient British
tongue to the mountains of Scotland
and Wales; and afterwards, when incorporated
with this, resisting the persecution
of the Normans; rather improving than
yielding under their endeavours to extirpate
it. The injuries of the Bishop of Winchester,
who, in Henry the Second's time,
was deprived of his fee for being "<i>an English
ideot, that could not speak French</i>," one
would fondly imagine had the effect due to
all persecutions, that of strengthening, not
subduing their objects.</p>

<p>After parting with some of the friends,
who had accompanied us from Mentz, and
taking in provision for the voyage, our oars
were again plyed, and we approached Bingerloch,
the commencement of that tremendous
pass of rocky mountains, which
enclose the Rhine nearly as far as Coblentz.
Bingerloch is one of the most dangerous
parts of the river; that, being here at once
impelled by the waters of the Nahe, compressed
by the projection of its boundaries,
and irritated by hidden rocks in its current,
makes an abrupt descent, frequently rendered
further dangerous by whirlpools.
Several German authors assert, that a part
of the Rhine here takes a channel beneath
its general bed, from which it does not
issue, till it reaches St. Goar, a distance of
probably twenty miles. The force and
rapidity of the stream, the aspect of the
dark disjointed cliffs, under which we
passed, and the strength of the wind, opposing
our entrance among their chasms,
and uniting with the sounding force of the
waters to baffle the dexterity of the boatmen,
who struggled hard to prevent the
vessel from being whirled round, were circumstances
of the true sublime, inspiring
terror in some and admiration in a high
degree.</p>

<p>Reviewing this now, in the leisure of
recollection, these nervous lines of Thomson
appear to describe much of the scene:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
<span class="ind3">The rous'd up river pours along;</span><br />
Resistless, roaring, dreadful, down it comes<br />
From the rude mountain, and the mossy wild,<br />
Tumbling thro' rocks abrupt, and sounding far,<br />
&hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; again constrain'd<br />
Between two meeting hills, it bursts away,<br />
Where rocks and woods o'erhang the turbid stream;<br />
There gathering triple force, rapid, and deep,<br />
It boils, and wheels, and foams, and thunders through.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Having doubled the sharp promontory,
that alters the course of the river, we saw in
perspective sometimes perpendicular rocks,
and then mountains dark with dwarf-woods,
shooting their precipices over the margin of
the water; a boundary which, for many
leagues, was not broken, on either margin,
except where, by some slight receding, the
rocks embosomed villages, lying on the edge
of the river, and once guarded them by the
antient castles on their points. A stormy
day, with frequent showers, obscured the
scenery, making it appear dreary, without
increasing its gloomy grandeur; but we
had leisure to observe every venerable ruin,
that seemed to tell the religious, or military
history of the country. The first of these
beyond Bingen, is the old castle of Bauzberg,
and, next, the church of St. Clement,
built in a place once greatly infested by
robbers. There are then the modern castle
of Konigstein, in which the French were
besieged in 1793, and the remains of the
old one, deserted for more than two hundred
years. Opposite to these is the village
of Assmans, or Hasemanshausen, celebrated
for the flavour of its wines; and near them
was formerly a warm bath, supplied by a
spring, now lost from its source to the
Rhine, notwithstanding many expensive
searches to regain it. About a mile farther,
is the antient castle of Falkenburg, and below
it the village of Drechsen; then the
ruins of an extensive chateau, called Sonneck,
beneath which the Rhine expands,
and encircles two small islands, that conclude
the district of the Rheingau.</p>

<p>After passing the small town of Lorrich,
on the eastern bank, the Rhine is again
straightened by rocky precipices, and rolls
hastily past the antient castle of Furstenberg,
which gives its name to one of the
dearest wines of the Rhine.</p>

<p>We now reached Bacharach, a town on
the left bank of the river, forming part of
the widely scattered dominions of the Elector
Palatine, who has attended to its prosperity
by permitting the Calvinists and Lutherans
to establish their forms of worship
there, under equal privileges with the Roman
Catholics.</p>

<p>It has a considerable commerce in Rhenish
wine; and its toll-house, near which all
vessels are compelled to stop, adds considerably
to the revenues of the Palatinate.
For the purpose of enforcing these, the antient
castle called Stahleck, founded in 1190,
was probably built; for Bacharach is the
oldest town of the Palatinate, and has
scarcely any history between the period
when it was annexed to that dominion and
the departure of the Romans, who are supposed
to have given it the name of <i>Bacchi
ara</i>, and to have performed some ceremonies
to that deity upon a stone, said to be
still concealed in the Rhine. In the year
1654, 1695, 1719, and 1750, when the
river was remarkably low, this stone is recorded
to have been seen near the opposite
island of Worth, and the country people
have given it the name of the <i>Aelterstein</i>.
As this extreme lowness of the waters never
happens but in the hottest years, the sight
of the Aelterstein is earnestly desired, as the
symptom of a prosperous vintage. The
river was unusually low when we passed
the island, but we looked in vain for this
stone, which is said to be so large, that five-and-twenty
persons may stand upon its surface.</p>

<p>Bacharach is in the list of places, ruined
by Louis the Fourteenth in 1689. The
whole town was then so carefully and methodically
plundered that the French commander,
during the last night of his stay,
had nothing to sleep on but straw; and,
the next day, this bedding was employed
in assisting to set fire to the town, which
was presently reduced to ashes.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="PFALTZ" id="PFALTZ">PFALTZ.</a></h3>

<p>About a mile lower is the island
of Pfaltz, or Pfalzgrafenstein, a place of
such antient importance in the history of
the Palatinate, that it has given its name
to the whole territory in Germany called
Pfaltz. It was probably the first residence
of the Counts, the peaceable possession of
which was one means of attesting the right
to the Palatinate; for, as a sign of such
possession, it was antiently necessary, that
the heir apparent should be born in a castle,
which still subsists in a repaired state upon
it. This melancholy fortress is now provided
with a garrison of invalids, who are
chiefly employed in guarding state prisoners,
and in giving notice to the neighbouring
toll-house of Kaub, of the approach of vessels
on the Rhine. Being much smaller
than is suitable to the value placed upon it,
it is secured from surprise by having no
entrance, except by a ladder, which is
drawn up at night.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="KAUB" id="KAUB">KAUB.</a></h3>

<p>Kaub, a Palatine town on the right
bank of the river, is also fortified, and claims
a toll upon the Rhine, notwithstanding its
neighbourhood to Bacharach; an oppression,
of which the expence is almost the
least inconvenience, for the toll-gatherers
do not come to the boats, but demand,
that each should stop, while one at least of
the crew goes on shore, and tells the number
of his passengers, who are also sometimes
required to appear. The officers do
not even think it necessary to wait at home
for this information, and our boatmen had
frequently to search for them throughout
the towns. So familiar, however, is this
injustice, that it never appeared to excite
surprise, or anger. The boatman dares not
proceed till he has found and satisfied the
officers; nor has he any means of compelling
them to be punctual. Ours was
astonished when we enquired, whether the
merchants, to whom such delays might
be important, could not have redress for
them.</p>

<p>The stay we made at Kaub enabled us,
however, to perceive that fine slate made
a considerable part of its traffic.</p>

<p>The Rhine, at Bacharach and Kaub, is
of great breadth; and the dark mountains,
that ascend from its margin, form a grand
vista, with antient chateaux still appearing
on the heights, and frequent villages edging
the stream, or studded among the cliffs.</p>

<p>Though the district of the Rheingau,
the vines of which are the most celebrated,
terminated some miles past, the vineyards
are scarcely less abundant here, covering the
lower rocks of the mountains, and creeping
along the fractures of their upper crags.
These, however, sometimes exhibit huge
projecting masses and walls of granite, so
entire and perpendicular, that not an handful
of soil can lodge for the nourishment
of any plant. They lie in vast oblique
strata; and, as in the valley of Andernach,
the angles of the promontories on one shore
of the river frequently correspond with the
recesses on the other.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="OBERWESEL" id="OBERWESEL">OBERWESEL</a></h3>

<p>Is another town, supported by the
manufacture and trade of wines, which are,
however, here shared by too many places
to bestow much wealth singly upon any.
Wine is also so important a production, that
all the Germans have some degree of connoisseurship
in it, and can distinguish its
quantities and value so readily, that the advantage
of dealing in it cannot be great, except
to those, who supply foreign countries.
The merits of the different vineyards form
a frequent topic of conversation, and almost
every person has his own scale of their
rank; running over with familiar fluency
the uncouth names of Johannesberg, Ammanshausen,
Hauptberg, Fuldische Schossberg,
Rudesheim, Hockheim, Rodtland,
Hinterhauser, Markerbrunner, Grafenberg,
Laubenheim, Bischeim, Nierstein, Harscheim
and Kapellgarren; all celebrated
vineyards in the Rheingau. The growth
and manufacture of these wines are treated
of in many books, from one of which we
translate an account, that seems to be the
most comprehensive and simple.</p>

<h4><span class="smallcaps">Of the Rhenish Vineyards and Wines</span>.</h4>

<p>The strongest and, as they are termed,
fullest-bodied wines, those, of course, which
are best for keeping, are produced upon
mountains of a cold and strong soil; the
most brisk and spirited on a warm and
gravelly situation. Those produced near the
middle of an ascent are esteemed the most
wholesome, the soil being there sufficiently
watered, without becoming too moist; and,
on this account, the vineyards of Hockheim
are more esteemed than some, whose produce
is better flavoured; on the contrary,
those at the feet of hills are thought so
unwholesome, on account of their extreme
humidity, that the wine is directed to be
kept for several years, before it is brought
to table. The finest flavour is communicated
by soils either argillaceous, or marly.
Of this sort is a mountain near Bacharach,
the wines of which are said to have a Muscadine
flavour and to be so highly valued,
that an Emperor, in the fourteenth century,
demanded four large barrels of them, instead
of 10,000 florins, which the city of Nuremberg
would have paid for its privileges.</p>

<p>A vineyard, newly manured, produces a
strong, spirited and well flavoured, but usually
an unwholesome wine; because the
manure contains a corrosive salt and a fat
sulphur, which, being dissolved, pass with
the juices of the earth into the vines. A
manure, consisting of street mud, old earth,
the ruins of houses well broken, and whatever
has been much exposed to the elements,
is, however, laid on, once in five or
six years, between the vintage and winter.</p>

<p>The sorts of vines, cultivated in the
<i>Rheingau</i>, are the low ones, called the
<i>Reistinge</i>, which are the most common and
ripen the first; those of <i>Klebroth</i>, or red
Burgundy, the wine of which is nearly purple;
of Orleans and of Lambert; and lastly
the tall vine, raised against houses, or supported
by bowers in gardens. The wines
of the two first classes are wholesome; those
of the latter are reputed dangerous, or, at
least, unfit to be preserved.</p>

<p>The vintagers do not pluck the branches
by hand, but carefully cut them, that the
grapes may not fall off; in the Rheingau
and about Worms the cultivators afterwards
bruise them with clubs, but those of Franckfort
with their feet; after which the grapes
are carried to the press, and the wine flows
from them by wooden pipes into barrels in
the cellar. That, which flows upon the
first pressure, is the most delicately flavoured,
but the weakest; the next is strongest and
most brisk; the third is sour; but the mixture
of all forms a good wine. The skins
are sometimes pressed a fourth time, and a
bad brandy is obtained from the fermented
juice; lastly, in the scarcity of pasturage in
this part of Germany, they are given for
food to oxen, but not to cows, their heat
being destructive of milk.</p>

<p>To these particulars it may be useful to
add, that one of the surest proofs of the
purity of Rhenish is the quick rising and
disappearance of the froth, on pouring it
into a glass: when the beads are formed
slowly and remain long, the wine is mixed
and factitious.</p>

<h3><a name="OBERWESEL_cont" id="OBERWESEL_cont">OBERWESEL.</a></h3>

<p>The account of which has been
interrupted by this digression, is the first
town of the Electorate of Treves, on this
side, to which it has belonged since 1312,
when its freedom as an imperial city,
granted by the Emperor, Frederic the Second,
was perfidiously seized by Henry the
Seventh, and the town given to him by his
brother Baldwin, the then Elector. The
new Sovereign enriched it with a fine collegiate
church, which still dignifies the shore
of the river. If he used any other endeavours
to make the prosperity of the place
survive its liberties, they appear to have
failed; for Oberwesel now resembles the
other towns of the Electorate, except that
the great number of towers and steeples tell
what it was before its declension into that
territory. The Town-house, rendered unnecessary
by the power of Baldwin, does
not exist to insult the inhabitants with the
memory of its former use; but is in ruins,
and thus serves for an emblem of the effects,
produced by the change.</p>

<p>Between Oberwesel and St. Goar, the
river is of extraordinary breadth, and the
majestic mountains are covered with forests,
which leave space for little more than a road
between their feet and the water. A group
of peasants, with baskets on their heads,
appeared now and then along the winding
path, and their diminutive figures, as they
passed under the cliffs, seemed to make the
heights shew more tremendous. When
they disappeared for a moment in the
copses, their voices, echoing with several
repetitions among the rocks, were heard at
intervals, and with good effect, as our oars
were suspended.</p>

<p>Soon after passing the island of Sand, we
had a perspective view of St. Goar, of the
strong fortress of Rhinfels, on the rocks beyond,
and of the small fortified town of
Goarhausen, on the opposite bank. The
mountains now become still more stupendous,
and many rivulets, or <i>becks</i>, which
latter is a German, as well as an English
term, descend from them into the river, on
either hand, some of which, in a season less
dry than the present, roar with angry torrents.
But the extreme violence, with
which the Rhine passes in this district, left
us less leisure than in others to observe its
scenery.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="ST_GOAR" id="ST_GOAR">ST. GOAR.</a></h3>

<p>We soon reached St. Goar, lying
at the feet of rocks on the western shore,
with its ramparts and fortifications spreading
far along the water, and mounting in
several lines among the surrounding cliffs,
so as to have a very striking and romantic
appearance. The Rhine no where, perhaps,
presents grander objects either of nature,
or of art, than in the northern perspective
from St. Goar. There, expanding
with a bold sweep, the river exhibits, at one
coup d'&oelig;il, on its mountainous shores, six
fortresses or towns, many of them placed
in the most wild and tremendous situations;
their antient and gloomy structures
giving ideas of the sullen tyranny of former
times. The height and fantastic shapes
of the rocks, upon which they are perched,
or by which they are overhung, and the
width and rapidity of the river, that, unchanged
by the vicissitudes of ages and the
contentions on its shores, has rolled at their
feet, while generations, that made its mountains
roar, have passed away into the silence
of eternity,&mdash;these were objects, which,
combined, formed one of the sublimest
scenes we had viewed.</p>

<p>The chief of the fortresses is that of
Rhinfels, impending over St. Goar, on the
west shore, its high round tower rising
above massy buildings, that crown two
rocks, of such enormous bulk and threatening
power, that, as we glided under them,
it was necessary to remember their fixed
foundations, to soften the awe they inspired.
Other fortifications extend down
the precipices, and margin the river, at their
base. Further on in the perspective, and
where the east bank of the Rhine makes its
boldest sweep, is the very striking and singular
castle of Platz, a cluster of towers,
overtopped by one of immense height, that,
perched upon the summit of a pyramidal
rock, seems ready to precipitate itself into
the water below. Wherever the cliffs beneath
will admit of a footing, the sharp angles
of fortifications appear.</p>

<p>On another rock, still further in the perspective,
is the castle of Thumberg, and, at
its foot, on the edge of the water, the
walled tower of Welmick. Here the Rhine
winds from the eye among heights, that
close the scene.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite to St. Goar, is Goarshausen,
behind which the rocks rise so
suddenly, as scarcely to leave space for the
town to lie between them and the river.
A flying bridge maintains a communication
between the two places, which, as well
as the fortress of Rhinfels, are under the
dominion of the Prince of Hesse Cassel.</p>

<p>The number of fortresses here, over
which Rhinfels is in every respect paramount,
seem to be the less necessary, because
the river itself, suddenly swoln by
many streams and vexed by hidden rocks,
is a sort of natural fortification to both
shores, a very little resistance from either
of which must render it impassable. Whether
the water has a subterraneous passage
from Bingen hither or not,&mdash;there are occasionally
agitations in this part, which
confound the skill of naturalists; and the
river is universally allowed to have a fall.
Near St. Goar, a sudden gust of wind,
assisted by the current, rendered our boat
so unmanageable, that, in spite of its heaviness
and of all the efforts of the watermen,
it was whirled round, and nearly forced
upon the opposite bank to that, on which
they would have directed it.</p>

<p>St. Goar is a place of great antiquity.
A dispute about the etymology of its name
is remarkable for the ludicrous contrariety
of the two opinions. One author maintains,
that it is derived from an hermit
named Goar, who, in the sixth century,
built a small chapel here. Another supposes
that Gewerb, the name of a neighbouring
fall in the Rhine, has been corrupted
to Gewer, and thence to Goar; after
which, considering that there is an island
called <i>Sand</i> in the river, and that a great
quantity of that material is hereabouts
thrown up, he finds the two words combine
very satisfactorily into a likeness of the present
denomination. The former opinion
is, however, promoted by this circumstance,
which the advocates of the latter may complain
of as a partiality, that a statue of St.
Goar is actually to be seen in the great
church, founded in 1440; and that, notwithstanding
the robberies and violences
committed in the church by a Spanish
army, the following inscription is still entire:</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
<span class="smallcaps">s. goar<br />
monachus gallus<br />
obiit 611.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>St. Goar is one of the largest places we
had yet passed, and has a considerable share
of the commerce carried on by the Rhine.
Having in time of war a numerous garrison,
and being a little resorted to on account
of its romantic situation, it has an
air of somewhat more animation than might
be expected, mingling with the gloom of
its walls, and the appearance of decay,
which it has in common with other German
towns. We were here required to
pay the fifth toll from Mentz, and were
visited by a Hessian serjeant, who demanded,
that our names and condition should be
written in his book. These being given,
not in the Saxon, but the Roman character,
he returned to require another edition of
them in German; so that his officer was
probably unable to read any other language,
or characters. This being complied
with, it seemed, that the noble garrison of
St. Goar had no further fears concerning
us, and we were not troubled by more of
the precautions used,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
"Lest foul invasion in disguise approach."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The fortress of Rhinfels, which commands
St. Goar, is frequently mentioned in
the histories of German wars. In the year
1255 it endured forty assaults of an army,
combined from sixty towns on the Rhine.
In 1692, the French General Tallard besieged
it in vain, retreating with the loss
of four thousand men, and nearly two hundred
officers; but, in 1758, the Marquis de
Castries surprised it with so much ingenuity
and vigour, that not a life was lost,
and it remained in possession of the French
till 1763, when it was restored by the
treaty of peace.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="BOPPART" id="BOPPART">BOPPART.</a></h3>

<p>We next reached the dismal old
town of Boppart, once an imperial city,
still surrounded with venerable walls, and
dignified by the fine Benedictine nunnery
and abbey of Marienberg, perched upon a
mountain above; an institution founded in
the eleventh century, for the benefit of noble
families only, and enriched by the donations
of several Emperors and Electors.
Boppart, like many other towns, is built
on the margin of the Rhine, whence it
spreads up the rocks, that almost impend
over the water, on which the clustered
houses are scarcely distinguishable from the
cliffs themselves. Besides the Benedictine
abbey, here is a convent of Carmelites, and
another of Franciscans; and the spot is such
as suited well the superstition of former
times, for</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
&mdash;"O'er the twilight groves, and dusky caves,<br />
Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,<br />
Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws<br />
A death-like silence, and a dread repose;<br />
Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,<br />
Shades every flower, and darkens every green,<br />
Deepens the murmur of the sailing floods,<br />
And breathes a browner horror o'er the woods."
</p>
</div>

<p>The river, expanding into a vast bay,
seems nearly surrounded by mountains, that
assume all shapes, as they aspire above each
other; shooting into cliffs of naked rock,
which impend over the water, or, covered
with forests, retiring in multiplied steeps
into regions whither fancy only can follow.
At their base, a few miserable cabins, and
half-famished vineyards, are all, that diversify
the savageness of the scene. Here two
Capuchins, belonging probably to the convent
above, as they walked along the shore,
beneath the dark cliffs of Boppart, wrapt
in the long black drapery of their order,
and their heads shrowded in cowls, that half
concealed their faces, were interesting figures
in a picture, always gloomily sublime.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="PLACE_OF_ANTIENT_ELECTIONS" id="PLACE_OF_ANTIENT_ELECTIONS"><span class="smallcaps">Place of Antient Elections</span>.</a></h3>

<p>Passing the town of Braubach and
the majestic castle of Marksberg, which we
had long observed, above the windings of
the stream, on a steep mountain, we came
to Rense, a small town, remarkable only for
its neighbourhood to a spot, on which the
elections of kings of the Romans, or, at
least, the meetings preliminary to them, are
believed to have antiently taken place. This
is distinguished at present by the remains of
a low octagonal building, open at top, and
accessible beneath by eight arches, in one
of which is a flight of steps. Within, is a
stone bench, supposed to be formed for the
Electors, who might ascend to it by these
steps. In the centre of the pavement below
is a thick pillar, the use of which, whether
as a tribune for the new king, or as a table
for receiving the attestations of the electors,
is not exactly known. That the building
itself, now called Koningstuhl, or King's
Throne, was used for some purposes of
election, appears from several German historians,
who mention meetings there in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and impute
them to antient customs.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="INTERMIXTURE" id="INTERMIXTURE"><span class="smallcaps">Intermixture of German Territories</span>.</a></h3>

<p>Nearly opposite to <i>Rense</i> is the
small town of <i>Oberlahnstein</i>, which belongs
to the Elector of Mentz, though separated
from his other dominions by those of several
Princes. To such intersections of one
territory with another the individual weakness
of the German Princes is partly owing;
while their collected body has not only necessarily
the infirmities of each of its members,
but is enfeebled by the counteraction
arising from an arrangement, which brings
persons together to decide a question, according
to a common interest, who are always
likely to have an individual one of
more importance to each than his share in
the general concern.</p>

<p>The banks of the Rhine afford many
instances of this disjunction of territory.
The Elector of Cologne has a town to the
southward of nearly all the dominions of
Treves; the Elector Palatine, whose possessions
on the east bank of the Rhine are
intersected by those of five or six other
Princes, crosses the river to occupy some
towns between the Electorates of Mentz
and Treves; the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel
does the same to his fortress of Rhinfels;
and the Elector of Mentz, in return, has a
strip of land and his chief country residence,
between the dominions of the two houses
of Hesse.</p>

<p>That this intermixture of territory exists,
without producing domestic violences, is,
however, obviously a proof, that the present
state of the Germanic body, weak as it
may be, with respect to foreign interests, is
well formed for the preservation of interior
peace. The aggrandizement of the Houses
of Austria and Prussia, which has been
supposed dangerous to the constitution of
the Empire, tends considerably to secure
its domestic tranquillity, though it diminishes
the independence of the lesser Sovereigns;
for the interests of the latter are
known to be ranged on one, or the other
side; and, as the House, to which each is
attached, is likely to interfere, upon any
aggression against them, the weaker Princes
are with-held from contests among themselves,
which would be accompanied by
wars, so very extensive and so disproportionate
to their causes.</p>

<p>Nor is the Chamber of Wetzlaar, or the
Court for deciding the causes of Princes, as
well as all questions relative to the constitution,
to be considered as a nullity. The
appointment of the Judges by the free but
secret votes of all Princes, subject to their
decrees, is alone wanting to make its purity
equal to its power. In minute questions,
the chief Princes readily receive its decision,
instead of that of arms, which, without it,
might sometimes be adopted; and the other
Sovereigns may be compelled to obey it,
the Chamber being authorised to command
any Prince to enforce its decrees by his
army, and to take payment of the expences
out of the dominions of his refractory
neighbour. An instance of such a command,
and of its being virtually effectual,
notwithstanding the ridicule, with which
it was treated, occurred, during the reign
of the late Frederic of Prussia; the story is
variously told, but the following account
was confirmed to us by an Advocate of the
Chamber of Wetzlaar.</p>

<p>The Landgrave of Hesse Cassel had disobeyed
several injunctions of the Chamber,
relative to a question, which had been constitutionally
submitted to them. At length,
the Judges had recourse to their power of
calling out what is called the <i>Arm&eacute;e Ex&eacute;cutrice
de l'Empire</i>, consisting of so many
troops of any Prince, not a party in the
cause, as may be sufficient for enforcing
submission. The Sovereign of Hesse Cassel
was not to be conquered by any of his immediate
neighbours, and they were induced
to direct their order to the King of Prussia,
notwithstanding the probability, that so unjust
a monarch would shew some resentment
of their controul.</p>

<p>Frederic consented to the propriety of
supporting the Chamber, but did not choose
to involve himself with the Landgrave, on
their account. He, therefore, sent him a
copy of their order, accompanied by a letter,
which, in his own style of courteous pleasantry,
yet with a sufficient shew of some
further intentions, admonished him to obey
them. The Landgrave assured him of his
readiness to conform, and the two Princes
had privately settled the matter, when the
King of Prussia resolved to obey and to
ridicule the Chamber of Wetzlaar. He
sent, by a public diligence, a serjeant of
foot, who, at the first Hessian garrison,
delivered a paper to the captain of the
guard, declaring himself to be the commander
of the <i>Arm&eacute;e Ex&eacute;cutrice</i>, set on foot
by order of the Chamber; and the army
consisted of two corporals, who waited at
the door! The Judges of Wetzlaar did not
shew, that they knew the disrespect, and
were contented that the King of Prussia
had reduced the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel
to obedience.</p>

<p>To this Court subjects may make appeals
from the orders of their immediate sovereigns,
when the question can be shewn to
have any general, or constitutional tendency.
Such a cause we heard of in Germany,
and it seemed likely to place the
Chamber in somewhat a delicate situation.
The Elector of Treves had banished a magistrate,
for having addressed himself to
Custine, during the invasion of the French,
in 1792, and requested to know whether
he might remain on a part of his property,
near their posts, and perform the duties of
his office, as usual. The magistrate appealed
to Wetzlaar; admitted the facts charged;
and set forth, that, in this part of his
conduct, he had exactly followed the example
of the Chamber itself, who, though at a
greater distance, had made a similar application.</p>

<hr class="minimal" />

<p>Soon after leaving Oberlahnstein, we
passed the mouth of the Lahn, a small
river, which descends from the mountains
of Wetteravia on the right, and washes silver
and lead mines in its course. It issues from
one of those narrow and gloomy forest-glens,
which had continually occurred on
the eastern bank since we left Boppart, and
which were once terrible for more than
their aspect, having been the haunt of robbers,
of whose crimes some testimonies still
remain in the tombs of murdered travellers
near the shore. In the ruins of castles and
abandoned fortresses within the recesses of
these wild mountains, such banditti took
up their abode; and these are not fancied
personages, for, in the year 1273, an Elector
of Mentz destroyed the deserted fortress
of Rheinberg, because it had been a rendezvous
for them.</p>

<p>Towards sun-set, the rain, which had
fallen at intervals during the day, ceased;
a fiery flush from the west was reflected on
the water, and partially coloured the rocks.
Sometimes, an oblique gleam glanced among
these glens, touching their upper
cliffs, but leaving their depths, with the
rivulets, that roared there, in darkness. As
the boat glided by, we could now and then
discover on the heights a convent, or a
chateau, lighted up by the rays, and which,
like the pictures in a magic lanthorn, appeared
and vanished in a moment, as we
passed on the current.</p>

<p>But the shores soon begin to wear a
milder aspect; the mountains of the western
bank soften into gradual heights; and
vineyards, which had disappeared near
Boppart, again climb along them. The
eastern shore is more abrupt, still bearing
on its points some antient buildings, till,
opposite to Coblentz, it shoots up into that
enormous mass, which sustains the fortress
of Ehrenbreitstein.</p>

<p>Having passed a Benedictine convent,
seated on the island of Oberworth, we
reached Coblentz as the moon began to tint
the rugged Ehrenbreitstein, whose towers
and pointed angles caught the light. Part
of the rock below, shaded by projecting
cliffs, was dark and awful, but the Rhine,
expanding at its feet, trembled with radiance.
There the flying-bridge, and its
sweeping line of boats, were just discernible.
On the left, the quay of Coblentz extended,
high and broad, crowned with handsome
buildings; with tall vessels lying along its
base.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="EHRENBREITSTEIN" id="EHRENBREITSTEIN">EHRENBREITSTEIN.</a></h3>

<p>We were now somewhat more
pleasantly lodged than before, at an inn
near the Rhine, almost opposite to the fortress,
the importance of which had, in the
mean time, greatly increased by the approach
of the French armies. The strength
of it was somewhat a popular topic. Being
considered as one of the keys of Germany
towards France, the Governor takes the
oaths not only to the Elector of Treves,
but to the Emperor and the Empire. As
it can be attacked but on one side, and that
is not towards the Rhine, a blockade is
more expected than a siege; and there are
storehouses in the rock for preserving a
great quantity of provisions. The supply
of water has been provided for so long since
as the fifteenth century, when three years
were passed in digging, with incredible
labour, a well through the solid rock. An
inscription on a part of the castle mentions
this work, and that the rock was hewn to
the depth of two hundred and eighty feet.
The possession of the fortress was confirmed
to the Elector of Treves by the treaty of
Westphalia in 1650.</p>

<p>In the morning, our boatmen crossed the
river from Coblentz, to pass under the walls
of Ehrenbreitstein, perhaps an established
symptom of submission. The river is still
of noble breadth, and, after the junction
with the Moselle, which immediately fronts
the old palace, flows with great, but even
rapidity. Its shores are now less romantic,
and more open; spreading on the left into
the plains of Coblentz, and swelling on the
right into retiring mountains.</p>

<h4><span class="smallcaps">Conversation Relative to France.</span></h4>

<p>But our attention was withdrawn from
the view, and our party in the cabin this
day increased, by a circumstance, that occurred
to our emigrant friend. Having
found a large sabre, which he thought was
of French manufacture, he was enquiring
for the owner, when it was claimed by a
gentleman, whom he recognised to be an
old friend, but with whose escape from
France he was unacquainted; so that he
had supposed, from his rank, he must have
fallen there. The meeting, on both sides,
was very affecting, and they shed some
tears, and embraced again and again, with
all the ardour of Frenchmen, before the
stranger was introduced to us, after which
we had the pleasure of his company as far
as Cologne.</p>

<p>This gentleman, a Lieutenant-Colonel
before the Revolution, had made his escape
from France so lately as May last, and his
conversation of course turned upon his late
condition. There were in most towns
many persons who, like himself, were obnoxious
for their principles, yet, being unsuspected
of active designs, and unreached
by the private malice of Roberspierre's
agents, were suffered to exist out of prison.
They generally endeavoured to lodge in
the houses of persons favourable to the
Revolution; went to no public places;
never visited each other; and, when they
met in the street, passed with an hasty or
concealed salutation. Their apartments were
frequently searched; and those, who had
houses, took care to have their cellars frequently
dug for saltpetre.</p>

<p>With respect to the prospect of any political
change, they had little hopes, and still
less of being able, by remaining in France,
to give assistance to the Combined Powers.
They expected nothing but some chance
of escape, which in general they would not
attempt, without many probabilities in their
favour, knowing the sure consequences of
being discovered. It was impossible for
them to pass by the common roads, being
exposed to examination at every town, and
by every patrol; but, in the day-time, they
might venture upon tracts through forests,
and, at night, upon cultivated ground; a
sort of journey, to which they were tempted
by the successes of others in it, but
which could not be performed, without
experienced guides. It will be heard with
astonishment, that, notwithstanding the
many difficulties and dangers of such an
employment, there were persons, who obtained
a living by conducting others to the
frontiers, without passing any town, village,
or military post; who, having delivered
one person, returned, with his recommendation,
to another, and an offer to escort
him for a certain sum. Our companion
had waited several months for a guide, the
person, whom he chose to trust, being under
prior engagements, in all of which he
was successful. They set out, each laden
with his share of provisions, in the dress of
peasants; and, without any other accident
than that of being once so near the patrols
as to hear their conversation, arrived in the
Electorate of Treves, from whence this
gentleman had been to Rastadt, for the
purpose of presenting himself to M. de
Cond&eacute;.</p>

<p>It was remarkable, that some of these
guides did not share the principles of those,
whom they conducted; yet they were
faithful to their engagements, and seemed
to gratify their humanity, as much as they
served their interests. Considering the many
contrivances, which are behind almost every
political transaction, it seems not improbable,
that these men were secretly encouraged
by some of the rulers, who wished
to be disencumbered from their enemies,
without the guilt of a massacre, or the unpopularity
of appearing to assist them.</p>

<p>The attachment to the new principles
seemed to be increased, when any circumstances
either of signal disadvantage, or
success, occurred in the course of a campaign.
The disasters of an army, it was
said, attracted sympathy; their victories
aroused pride. Such a change of manners
and of the course of education had taken
place, that the rising generation were
all <i>enrag&eacute;es</i> in favour of the Revolution;
of which the following was a remarkable
instance: Two young ladies, the daughters
of a baron, who had remained passively in
the country, without promoting, or resisting
the Revolution, were then engaged in a
law-suit with their father, by which they
demanded a maintenance, separate from
him, "he being either an Aristocrat, or a
Neutralist, with whom they did not choose
to reside." They did not pretend to any
other complaint, and, it was positively believed,
had no other motive. Yet these ladies
had been previously educated with the
nicest care, by the most accomplished instructors,
and, in fact, with more expence
than was suitable to their father's income,
having been intended for places at the
Court. The children of the poorer classes
were equally changed by education, and
those of both sexes were proficients in all
the Revolutionary songs and catechisms.</p>

<p>This conversation passed while we were
floating through the vale of Ehrenbreitstein,
where the river, bending round the plains
of Coblentz, flows through open and richly
cultivated banks, till it enters the valley of
Andernach, where it is again enclosed
among romantic rocks. The places, washed
by it in its passage thither, are the villages
of Neuralf, Warschheim, Nerenberg,
Malter, the old castle of Malterberg, the
village of Engus, the fine electoral palace
of Schonbornust, the neat town and palace
of Neuwied, and the chateau of Friedrichstein,
called by the country people the Devil's
Castle, from that love of the wonderful,
which has taught them to people it
with apparitions.</p>

<p>Was now the head-quarters of a
legion raised by the Prince of Salm, for the
pay of Great Britain; and a scarlet uniform,
somewhat resembling the English, was frequent
on the quay. We heard of several
such <i>corps</i> in Germany, and of the facility
with which they are raised, the English pay
being as eight-pence to two-pence better
than those of Austria and Prussia. Recruits
receive from one to two crowns bounty:
whether it is equally true, that the officers
are, notwithstanding, allowed ten pounds
for each, we cannot positively assert; but
this was said within the hearing of several
at Cologne, and was not contradicted. <i>La
solde d'Angleterre</i> is extremely popular in
Germany; and the great wealth of the
English nation begins to be very familiarly
known.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="ANDERNACH" id="ANDERNACH">ANDERNACH</a></h3>

<p>Was occupied by Imperial troops;
and, as we entered the gorge of its rocky
pass, it was curious to observe the appearances
of modern mixed with those of antient
warfare; the soldiers of Francis the
Second lying at the foot of the tower of
Drusus; their artillery and baggage waggons
lining the shore along the whole extent
of the walls.</p>

<p>In this neighbourhood are three celebrated
mineral springs, of which one rises
in the domain of the Carmelite monastery
of Jonniesstein; the second, called Ponterbrunnen,
is so brisk and spirited, that the
labourers in the neighbouring fields declare
it a remedy for fatigue as well as thirst; and
a third, called Heilbrunnen, has so much
fixed air, as to effervesce slightly when
mixed with wine.</p>

<p>The interesting valley of Andernach has
been already described. Its scenery, viewed
now from the water, was neither so beautiful,
or so striking, as from the road, by
which we had before passed. The elevation
of the latter, though not great, enabled the
eye to take a wider range, and to see
mountains, now screened by the nearer
rocks of the shore, which added greatly to
the grandeur of the scene. The river itself
was then also a noble object, either expanding
below, or winding in the distance; but,
now that we were upon its level, its appearance
lost much both in dignity and extent,
and even the rocks on its margin
seemed less tremendous, when viewed from
below. Something, however, should be allowed
in this last respect to our having
just quitted wilder landscapes; for, though
the banks of the Rhine, in its course from
Bingen to Coblentz, are less various and
beautiful, than in its passage between Andernach
and Bonn, they are more grand
and sublime.</p>

<p>But the merits of the different situations
for the view of river scenery have been
noticed and contended for by the three
persons most authorised by their taste to
decide upon them; of whom <span class="smallcaps">Gray</span> has
left all his enthusiasm, and nearly all his
sublimity, to his two surviving friends; so
that this opinion is to be understood only
with respect to the scenery of the Rhine,
and does not presume to mingle with the
general question between them. The
Rhine now passes by the village and castle
of Hammerstein, which, with those of
Rheineck, were nearly laid waste by Louis
the Fourteenth, the castle of Argendorff
and the towns of Lintz and Rheinmagen,
all exhibiting symptoms of decay, though
Lintz is called a commercial town.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Roland</span>'s Castle appears soon after,
and, almost beneath it, the island, that bears
Adelaide's convent, called Rolands Werth,
or the Worth of Roland.</p>

<p>We were now again at the base of the
Seven Mountains, whose summits had long
aspired in the distance, and, as we passed
under the cliffs of Drakenfels, hailed the
delightful plain of Goodesberg, though
much of it was concealed by the high
sedgy bank of the Rhine on the left. The
spreading skirts of these favourite mountains
accompanied us nearly to Bonn, and displayed
all their various charms of form and
colouring in this our farewell view of them.</p>

<p>The town and palace of Bonn extend
with much dignity along the western bank,
where the Rhine makes a very bold sweep;
one wing of the former overlooking the
shore, and the want of uniformity in the
front, which is seen obliquely, being concealed
by the garden groves; the many
tall spires of the great church rise over the
roof of the palace, and appear to belong to
the building.</p>

<p>After leaving Bonn, the shores have little
that is interesting, unless in the retrospect
of the Seven Mountains, with rich woodlands
undulating at their feet; and when
these, at length, disappear, the Rhine loses
for the rest of its course the wild and sublime
character, which distinguishes it between
Bingen and Bonn. The rich plain,
which it waters between the latter place and
Cologne, is studded, at every gentle ascent,
that bounds it, with abbeys and convents,
most of them appropriated to the maintenance
of noble Chapters.</p>

<p>Of these, the first is the Ladies Chapter
of Vilich, founded in the year 1190, by
Megiegor, a Count and Prince of Guelderland,
who endowed it richly, and made his
own daughter the first abbess; a lady, who
had such excellent, notions of discipline,
that, when any nuns neglected to sing in
the choir, she thought a heavy blow on the
cheek the best means of restoring their
voices. This Chapter is one of the richest
in Germany, and is peculiarly valuable to
the nobility of this Electorate from its
neighbourhood to Bonn, where many of
the ladies pass great part of the year with
their families. On the other side of the
river is the Benedictine abbey of Siegberg,
appropriated also to nobles, and lying in
the midst of its own domains, of which a
small town, at the foot of its vineyards, is
part. Admission into this society is an
affair of the most strict and ceremonious
proof, as to the sixteen quarterings in the
arms of the candidate, each of which must
be unblemished by any plebeian symptoms.
Accompanied by his genealogy, these quarterings
are exposed to view for six weeks
and three days, before the election; and,
as there is an ample income to be contended
for, the candidates do not hesitate to impeach
each others' claims by every means
in their power. The prelate of this abbey
writes himself Count of Guls, Strahlen and
Neiderpleis, and has six provostships within
his jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Besides this, and similar buildings, the
Rhine passes not less than twenty villages
in its course from Bonn to Cologne, a distance
of probably five-and-twenty English
miles.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="COLOGNE" id="COLOGNE">COLOGNE</a></h3>

<p>Now began to experience the inconveniences
of its neighbourhood to the
seat of war, some of which had appeared
at Bonn from the arrival of families, who
could not be lodged in the former place.
We were no sooner within the gates, than
the throng of people and carriages in a city,
which only a few weeks before was almost
as silent as gloomy, convinced us we should
not find a very easy welcome. The sentinels,
when they made the usual enquiry
as to our inn, assured us, that there had
been no lodgings at the Hotel de Prague
for several days, and one of them followed
us, to see what others we should find.
Through many obstructions by military
and other carriages, we, however, reached
this inn, and were soon convinced that
there could be no room, the landlord shewing
us the chaises in which some of his
guests slept, and his billiard table already
loaden with beds for others. There was
so much confusion meanwhile in the adjoining
square, that, upon a slight assurance,
we could have believed the French to be
within a few miles of the city, and have
taken refuge on the opposite bank of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>At length, our host told us, that what he
believed to be the worst room in the place
was still vacant, but might not be so half
an hour longer. We followed his man to
it, in a distant part of the city, and saw
enough in our way of parties taking refreshment
in carriages, and gentlemen carrying
their own baggage, to make us contented
with a viler cabin than any person
can have an idea of, who has not been
out of England. The next morning we
heard from the mistress of it how fortunately
we had been situated, two or three
families having passed the night in the open
market-place, and great numbers in their
carriages.</p>

<p>The occasion of this excessive pressure
upon Cologne was the entry of the French
into Brussels, their advances towards Liege,
and the immediate prospect of the siege of
Maestricht, all which had dispeopled an immense
tract of territory of its wealthier inhabitants,
and driven them, together with
the French emigrants, upon the confines of
Holland and Germany. The Austrian hospitals having
been removed from Maestricht,
five hundred waggons, laden with
sick and wounded, had passed through Cologne
the day before. The carriages on
the roads from Maestricht and Liege were
almost as close as in a procession, and at
<i>Aix la Chapelle</i>, where these roads meet,
there was an obstruction for some hours.
While we were at Cologne, another detachment
of hospital waggons arrived, some
hundreds of which we had the misfortune
to see, for they passed before our window.
They were all uncovered, so that the emaciated
figures and ghastly countenances of
the soldiers, laid out upon straw in each,
were exposed to the rays of a burning sun,
as well as to the fruitless pity of passengers;
and, as the carriages had no springs, it
seemed as if these half-sacrificed victims to
war would expire before they could be
drawn over the rugged pavement of Cologne.
Any person, who had once witnessed
such a sight, would know how to estimate
the glories of war, even though there
should be a mercenary at every corner to
insult his unavoidable feelings and the eternal
sacredness of peace, with the slander of
disaffection to his country.</p>

<p>We had some thoughts of resuming our
course by land from this place, but were
now convinced, that it was impracticable,
seeing the number of post-horses, which
were engaged, and judging of the crowds
of travellers, that must fill the inns on the
road. Our watermen from Mentz were,
however, not allowed to proceed lower, so
that we had to comply with the extortions
of others, and to give nine louis for a boat
from Cologne to Nimeguen. Having, not
without some difficulty, obtained this, and
stored it with provisions, we again embarked
on the Rhine, rejoicing that we were
not, for a second night, to make part of the
crowd on shore.</p>

<p>Cologne, viewed from the river, appears
with more of antient majesty than from
any other point. Its quays, extending far
along the bank, its lofty ramparts, shaded
with old chesnuts, and crowned by many
massy towers, black with age; the old gateways
opening to the Rhine, and the crowd
of steeples, overtopping all, give it a venerable
and picturesque character. But, however
thronged the city now was, the shore
without was silent and almost deserted; the
sentinels, watching at the gates and looking
out from the ramparts, or a few women
gliding beneath, wrapt in the nun-like scarf,
so melancholy in its appearance and so generally
worn at Cologne, were nearly the
only persons seen.</p>

<p>The shores, though here flat, when compared
with those to the southward, are high
enough to obstruct the view of the distant
mountains, that rise in the east; in the
south, the wild summits of those near Bonn
were yet visible, but, after this faint glimpse,
we saw them no more.</p>

<p>About two miles below Cologne, the west
bank of the Rhine was covered with hospital
waggons and with troops, removed from
them, for the purpose of crossing the river,
to a mansion, converted by the Elector into
an hospital. About a mile lower, but on
the opposite bank, is Muhleim, a small
town in the dominions of the Elector Palatine,
which, in the beginning of the present
century, was likely to become a rival
of Cologne. A persecution of the Protestant
merchants of the latter place drove them to
Muhleim, where they erected a staple, and
began to trade with many advantages over
the mother city; but the pusillanimity of
the Elector Palatine permitted them to sink
under the jealousy of the Colonese merchants;
their engines for removing heavy
goods from vessels to the shore were ordered
to be demolished; and the commerce of
the place has since consisted chiefly in the
exportation of grain.</p>

<p>The shores are now less enlivened by
villages than in the <i>Rheingau</i> and other
districts to the southward, where the cultivation
and produce of the vineyards afford,
at least, so much employment, that six or
seven little towns, each clustered round its
church, are frequently visible at once. The
course of the river being also wider and
less rapid, the succession of objects is slower,
and the eye is often wearied with the uniform
lowness of the nearer country, where
the antient castle and the perched abbey, so
frequent in the Rheingau, seldom appear.
Corn lands, with a slight intermixture of
wood, border the river from hence to Dusseldorff,
and the stream flows, with an even
force, through long reaches, scarcely distinguished
from each other by any variety of
the country, or intervention of towns.
Those, which do occur, are called Stammel,
Niel, Flietert, Merkenich, Westdorff, Langelt,
and Woringen; in which last place,
the burgesses of Cologne, at the latter end
of the thirteenth century, stood a siege
against their Archbishop, and, by a successful
resistance, obtained the enjoyment of
some commercial rights, here so rare as to
be called privileges. After Dormagen, a
small town very slightly provided with the
means of benefiting itself by the river, we
came opposite to Zons, the fortifications of
which are so far preserved, as that the
boatmen on the Rhine are required to stop
before them and give an account of their
cargoes.</p>

<p>We were listening to an old French
song, and had almost forgotten the chance
of interruption from any abuses of power,
when the steersman called to us in a low,
but eager voice, and enquired whether we
would permit him to attempt passing the
castle, where, if we landed, we might probably
be detained an hour, or, if the officer
was at supper, for the whole night. By
the help of twilight and our silence, he
thought it possible to glide unnoticed under
the opposite bank, or that we should be in
very little danger, if the sentinels should
obey their order for firing upon all vessels
that might attempt to pass. The insolent
tediousness of a German customhouse, and
the probable wretchedness of inns at such a
placed as this, determined us in favour of the
man's proposal; we were silent for a quarter
of an hour; the men with-held their
oars; and the watchful garrison of Zons
saw us not, or did not think a boat of two
tons burthen could be laden with an army
for the conquest of Germany.</p>

<p>The evening was not so dark as entirely
to deny the view of either shore, while we
continued to float between both, and to
trace the features of three or four small
towns upon them. Neuss, being at some
little distance from the river, was concealed;
but we had an accurate remembrance of its
hideousness, and, recognizing it for the
model of many towns since seen, were
pleased with a mode of travelling, which
rendered us independent of them. The
same mode, however, prevented us from
visiting Dusseldorff, which we did not
reach, till after the shutting of the gates;
so that, had we stayed, we must have passed
the night in our boat on the outside, a sacrifice
of too much time to be made, while
an army was advancing to the opposite
shore. Being compelled to remain in the
boat, we thought it desirable to be, at the
same time, proceeding with the stream, and
suffered the steersman to attempt passing
another garrison, by whom, as he said, we
should otherwise be inevitably detained for
the night. He did not effect this, without
being noticed by the sentinels, who called
and threatened to fire; but, as the boatmen
assured us this would scarcely be done,
without leave from an officer, who might
not be immediately at hand, we yielded to
their method of pressing forward as hastily
as possible, and were presently out of sight
of Dusseldorff, of which we had seen only
the walls and the extensive palace, rising
immediately above the water. In the next
reach, the boatmen stopped to take breath,
and then confessed, that, though we had
escaped being detained, as they had said,
they had saved some florins due for tolls
here and at Zons; which saving was their
motive for running the risk. Though we
would not have encouraged such a purpose,
had we been aware of it, since the neglect
of an unjust payment might produce an
habitual omission of a just one, it did not
seem necessary to say much, in behalf of a
toll on the Rhine, for which there is no
other pretence and no other authority than
the power to enforce it.</p>

<p>The loss of Dusseldorff, we were assured,
was the less, because the pictures of the
celebrated gallery had been carried off to
meet those of Manheim, at Munich.</p>

<p>It was now dark for two or three hours,
but we did not hear of any town or view
worth waiting to observe. The first object
in the dawn was the island of Kaiserwerth,
on which there is a small town, twice besieged
in the wars of Louis the Fourteenth,
and now in the condition, to which military
glory has reduced so many others.
One of the mines in the last siege blew
so large a part of the walls over the island
into the Rhine, that the navigation of the
river was, for some time, obstructed by
them. The dominion of this island, for
which the Elector of Cologne and the Elector
Palatine contended, was decided so lately
as 1768 by the authority of the Chamber
of Wetzlaar, who summoned the King of
Prussia to assist them with his troops, as the
<i>Arm&eacute;e ex&eacute;cutrice de l'Empire</i>, and the Elector
Palatine was put in possession of it,
notwithstanding the remonstrances of his
rival.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced, we reached
the villages of Kreuzberg, Rheinam and
Einingen; and, at five, stopped at Urdingen,
a town on the west bank of the Rhine,
at which the Elector of Cologne takes his
northernmost toll, and a place of more commerce
than we had expected to see short
of Holland. Great part of this is in timber,
which it adds to the floats annually
sent to that country; a sort of expedition
so curious and useful, that we shall make
no apology for introducing the following
account of it.</p>

<h4><span class="smallcaps">Timber Floats on the Rhine</span>.</h4>

<p>These are formed chiefly at Andernach,
but consist of the fellings of almost
every German forest, which, by streams,
or short land carriage, can be brought to
the Rhine. Having passed the rocks of
Bingen and the rapids of St. Goar in small
detachments, the several rafts are compacted
at some town not higher than Andernach,
into one immense body, of which an idea
may be formed from this list of dimensions.</p>

<p>The length is from 700 to 1000 feet;
the breadth from 50 to 90; the depth,
when manned with the whole crew, usually
seven feet. The trees in the principal
rafts are not less than 70 feet long, of
which ten compose a raft.</p>

<p>On this sort of floating island, five hundred
labourers of different classes are employed,
maintained and lodged, during the
whole voyage; and a little street of deal
huts is built upon it for their reception.
The captain's dwelling and the kitchen are
distinguished from the other apartments by
being somewhat better built.</p>

<p>The first rafts, laid down in this structure,
are called the foundation, and are always
either of oak, or fir-trees, bound together
at their tops, and strengthened with
firs, fastened upon them crossways by iron
spikes. When this foundation has been
carefully compacted, the other rafts are laid
upon it, the trees of each being bound together
in the same manner, and each <i>stratum</i>
fastened to that beneath it. The surface
is rendered even; storehouses and other
apartments are raised; and the whole is
again strengthened by large masts of oak.</p>

<p>Before the main body proceed several
thin and narrow rafts, composed only of
one floor of timbers, which, being held at a
certain distance from the float by masts of
oak, are used to give it direction and force,
according to the efforts of the labourers
upon them.</p>

<p>Behind it, are a great number of small
boats, of which fifteen or sixteen, guided by
seven men each, are laden with anchors
and cables; others contain articles of light
rigging, and some are used for messages
from this populous and important fleet to
the towns, which it passes. There are
twelve sorts of cordage, each having a name
used only by the float-masters; among the
largest are cables of four hundred yards
long and eleven inches diameter. Iron
chains are also used in several parts of the
structure.</p>

<p>The consumption of provisions on board
such a float is estimated for each voyage at
fifteen or twenty thousand pounds of fresh
meat, between forty and fifty thousand
pounds of bread, ten or fifteen thousand
pounds of cheese, one thousand or fifteen
hundred pounds of butter, eight hundred
or one thousand pounds of dried meat, and
five or six hundred tons of beer.</p>

<p>The apartments on the deck are, first,
that of the pilot, which is near one of the
magazines, and, opposite to it, that of the
persons called masters of the float: another
class, called masters of the valets, have also
their apartment; near it is that of the valets,
and then that of the sub-valets; after
this are the cabins of the <i>tyrolois</i>, or last
class of persons, employed in the float, of
whom eighty or an hundred sleep upon
straw in each, to the number of more than
four hundred in all. There is, lastly, one
large eating-room, in which the greater part
of this crew dine at the same time.</p>

<p>The pilot, who conducts the fleet from
Andernach to Dusseldorff, quits it there,
and another is engaged at the same salary,
that is, five hundred florins, or 42 l.; each
has his sub-pilot, at nearly the same price.
About twenty tolls are paid in the course
of the voyage, the amount of which varies
with the size of the fleet and the estimation
of its value, in which latter respect the
proprietors are so much subject to the caprice
of customhouse officers, that the first
signal of their intention to depart is to collect
all these gentlemen from the neighbourhood,
and to give them a grand dinner
on board. After this, the float is sounded
and measured, and their demands upon the
owners settled.</p>

<p>On the morning of departure, every
labourer takes his post, the rowers on their
benches, the guides of the leading rafts on
theirs, and each boat's crew in its own
vessel. The eldest of the valet-masters then
makes the tour of the whole float, examines
the labourers, passes them in review,
and dismisses those, who are unfit. He afterwards
addresses them in a short speech;
recommends regularity and alertness; and
repeats the terms of their engagement, that
each shall have five crowns and a half, besides
provisions, for the ordinary voyage;
that, in case of delay by accident, they shall
work three days, gratis; but that, after
that time, each shall be paid at the rate
of twelve creitzers, about four pence, per
day.</p>

<p>After this, the labourers have a repast,
and then, each being at his post, the pilot,
who stands on high near the rudder, takes
off his hat and calls out, "Let us all pray."
In an instant there is the happy spectacle
of all these numbers on their knees, imploring
a blessing on their undertaking.</p>

<p>The anchors, which were fastened on
the shores, are now brought on board, the
pilot gives a signal, and the rowers put the
whole float in motion, while the crews of
the several boats ply round it to facilitate
the departure.</p>

<p>Dort in Holland is the destination of
all these floats, the sale of one of which
occupies several months, and frequently
produces 350,000 florins, or more than
30,000 l.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="URDINGEN" id="URDINGEN">URDINGEN.</a></h3>

<p>Has a neat market-place and some
symptoms of greater comfort than are usual
in the towns of the Electorate of Cologne;
but it is subject to violent floods, so much
so, that at the inn, which is, at least, an
hundred and fifty yards from the shore, a
brass plate, nailed upon the door of the
parlour, relates, that the river had risen
to that height; about five feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>After resting here, five hours, we returned
to our little bark, with the spirits
inspired by favourable weather, and were
soon borne away on the ample current of
the Rhine.</p>

<p>Large Dutch vessels, bound to Cologne,
now frequently appeared, and refreshed us
once again with the shew of neatness, industry
and prosperity. The boatmen learned,
that several of these were from Rotterdam,
laden with the effects of Flemish refugees,
brought thither from Ostend; and
others were carrying military stores for the
use, as they said, of the Emperor. The
ordinary trade of the Dutch with Germany,
in tea, coffee, English cloths and English
hardware, which we had heard at Mentz
was slackened by the expected approach of
armies, now seemed to be exchanged for
the conveyance of property from scenes of
actual distress to those not likely to be long
exempted from it.</p>

<p>A little beyond Urdingen, the town of
Bodberg marks the northern extremity of
the long and narrow dominions of Cologne,
once so far connected with Holland, as
that the Archbishop had jurisdiction over
the Bishop of Holland, and the Chapter of
Utrecht. But Philip the Second, before the
States had resisted his plundering, obtained
of the Pope, that they should not be subject
to any foreign see; and the Bishop had
a residence assigned to him at Haerlem.</p>

<p>The Rhine is now bounded on the left
by the country of Meurs; and, having, after
a few miles, part of the Duchy of Cleves
on the right, it becomes thus enclosed by
the territories of the King of Prussia, under
whose dominion it rolls, till the States of
Guelderland repose upon one bank, and,
soon after, those of Utrecht, on the other.
We were here, of course, in the country of
tolls; and our waterman could not promise
how far we should proceed in the day, since
it was impossible to estimate the delays of
the collectors. Meurs has no place, except
small villages, near the river; but, at the
commencement of the Duchy of Cleves, the
influx of the Ruhr into the Rhine makes
a small port, at which all vessels are obliged
to stop, and pay for a Prussian pass. Some
Dutch barks, of probably one hundred and
twenty tons burthen, we were assured
would not be dismissed for less than fifty
ducats, or twenty guineas each. The town
is called the Ruhort, and we had abundance
of time to view it, for the Collector
would not come to the boat, but ordered
that we should walk up, and make our appearance
before him.</p>

<p>It is a small place, rendered busy by a
dock-yard for building vessels to be employed
on the Rhine, and has somewhat of
the fresh appearance, exhibited by such
towns as seem to be built for present use,
rather than to subsist because they have once
been erected. In the dock, which opens to
the Ruhr, two vessels of about sixty tons
each were nearly finished, and with more
capital, many might no doubt be built for
the Dutch, timber and labour being here
much cheaper than in Holland.</p>

<p>After the boatman had satisfied the Collector,
we resumed our voyage, very well
contented to have been detained only an
hour. The woody heights of Cleves now
broke the flat monotony of the eastern
shore, the antiquity of whose forests is commemorated
by Tacitus in the name of <i>Saltus
Teutoburgensis</i>, supposed to have been
bounded here by the town now called
Duisbourg:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&hellip; &hellip; &hellip; "<i>haud procul Teutoburgensi saltu,
in quo reliqui&aelig; Vari legionumque insepult&aelig; dicebantur</i>"&mdash;
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="poem">
<p>
"Unburied remain,<br />
Inglorious on the plain."<br />
</p></div>

<p>These forests were also celebrated for
their herds of wild horses; and the town
of Duisbourg, having been rendered an
University in 1655, is thus panegyrized by
a German poet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
<i>Dis ist die Deutsche Burg, vor langst gar hochgeehrt<br />
Von vielen K&ouml;nig und auch Kaiserlichen Kronen:<br />
Der sch&ouml;ne Musenthron, wo kluge Leute wohnen;<br />
Und wo die Kaufmannschaft so manchen B&uuml;rger n&auml;hrt.</i>
</p>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
This is the German town, that's fam'd so long<br />
By throned Kings, and gentle Muses' song;<br />
Where learned folks live well on princely pay,<br />
And commerce makes so many Burghers gay.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Of the commerce there were still some
signs in half a dozen vessels, collected on
the beach. Whether the University also
subsists, or is any thing more than a free
school, which is frequently called an University
in Germany, we did not learn.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="WESEL" id="WESEL">WESEL.</a></h3>

<p>After five or six small towns, or
villages, more, the Rhine reaches the well
known fortified town and state prison of
Wesel; a place, not always unfavourable to
freedom, for here <span class="smallcaps">Rapin</span>, driven from the
district now called La Vend&eacute;e in France,
by Louis the Fourteenth's persecution of
Protestants, retired to write his History;
recollecting, perhaps, that it had before
sheltered refugees from the tyranny of the
Duke of Alva, and our sanguinary Mary.</p>

<p>The towers and citadel of Wesel give it
the appearance of a military place, and it is
frequently so mentioned; but the truth is,
that the late King of Prussia, with the same
fear of his subjects, which was felt by
Joseph the Second in Flanders, demolished
all the effectual works, except those of the
citadel; a policy not very injurious to the
Monarch in this instance, but which, in
Flanders, has submitted the country to be
twice over-run in three years, and has in
fact been the most decisive of passed events
in their influence upon present circumstances.</p>

<p>The reformed worship is exercised in the
two principal churches, but the Catholics
have two or three monasteries, and there is
a Chapter of Noble Ladies, of whom two
thirds are Protestants, and one third Catholic;
an arrangement which probably accounts
for their having no settled and common
residence.</p>

<p>Opposite to Wesel is Burick, the fortifications
of which remain, and are probably
intended to serve instead of the demolished
works of the former place, being connected
with it by a flying-bridge over the Rhine.
A little lower are the remains of the old
chateau of Furstemberg, on a hill where the
ladies of the noble Cistercian nunnery of
Furstemberg had once a delightful seat, now
deserted for the society of Xanten.</p>

<p>Xanten, the first place at which we had
stopped in Germany, and the last, for a
long tract, which we had seen with pleasure,
Xanten, now distinguishable, at a small
distance from the river, by its spires, reminded
us of the gay hopes we had formed
on leaving it; with a new world spread out
before us, for curiosity, and, as we thought,
for admiration; yet did not render the remembrance
of disappointment, as to the last
respect, painful, for even the little information
we had gained seemed to be worth the
labour of acquiring it.</p>

<p>The exchange of indefinite for exact
ideas is for ever desirable. Without this
journey of eleven or twelve hundred miles
we should have considered Germany, as its
position in maps and description in books
represent it, to be important, powerful and
prosperous; or, even if it had been called
wretched, the idea would have been indistinct,
and the assertion, perhaps, not wholly
credited. The greatest and, as it is reasonable
to believe, the best part of Germany
we have now seen, and, in whatever train
of reasoning it is noticed, have an opinion
how it should be valued. Those, who cannot
guess at causes, may be sure of effects;
and having seen, that there is little individual
prosperity in Germany, little diffusion
of intelligence, manners, or even of the
means for comfort, few sources of independence,
or honourable wealth, and no
examples of the poverty, in which there
may be pride, it was not less perceptible,
that there can be no general importance, no
weight in the balance of useful, that is,
peaceful power, and no place, but that of
an instrument, even in the desperate exercises
of politics.</p>

<p>A respect for the persons of learning, or
thought, who live, as the impertinence of
high and the ignorance of low society
forces them to live, in a strict and fastidious
retirement, cannot alter the general
estimation of the country, in any respect
here considered; their conversation with
each other has no influence upon the community;
their works cannot have a present,
though they will have a general and a permanent
effect. The humbler classes, from
whom prosperity should result in peace, and
strength in war, give little of either to Germany;
and man is very seldom negatively
stationed; when not useful to his fellow-creatures,
he is generally somewhat injurious.
The substantial debasement of the
German peasantry, that is, their want of
ordinary intelligence, re-acts upon the means
that produced it, and, continuing their inferiority,
continues many injurious effects
upon the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>That Germany should be thus essentially
humble, perhaps, none would have ventured
to foresee. The materialist could not have
found it in the climate. The politician
might hastily expect it from the arbitrary
character of the governments, but must
hesitate, when he recollects how France advanced
in science and manufactures, under
the dominion of Louis the Fourteenth,
greatly more despotic than the usual administrations
in Germany. Perhaps, the
only solution for this difference of effects
from apparently similar causes is, that the
greater extent of his territory, as well as
the better opportunities of his subjects for
commerce, enabled Louis to gratify his taste
for splendour, at the same time that they
shewed his ambition a means of indulgence,
by increasing the means of his people.
Germany, frittered into several score of sovereignties,
has no opulent power; no considerable
income, remaining after the payment
of its armies; few wealthy individuals.
The Emperor, with fifty-six titles,
does not gain a florin by his chief dignity;
or Granvelle, the Minister of Charles the
Fifth, would have been contradicted when
he said so in the Chamber of Princes. The
Elector Palatine is almost the only Prince,
whose revenue is not absorbed by political,
military and household establishments; and
though, in an advanced state of society, or
in opulent nations, what is called patronage
is seldom necessary, and must, perhaps, be
as injurious to the happiness as it is to the
dignity of those who receive it, nothing is
more certain than that there have been
periods in the history of all countries, when
the liberality of the Prince, or the more independent
protection of beneficed institutions,
was necessary to the existence of
curiosity and knowledge. At such times,
a large expenditure, if directed by taste, or
even by vanity, afforded a slow recompense
for the aggressions, that might support it,
by spreading a desire of distinction for some
intellectual accomplishment, as the claim to
notice from the court; and the improvement
of mind circulated, by more general
encouragement, till every town and village
had its men of science. Thus it was that
the despotism of Louis the Fourteenth had
a different effect from that of his contemporary
German Princes, who, by no oppressions,
could raise a sufficient income, to
make their own expenditure the involuntary
means of improving the intellectual
condition of their people.</p>

<p>From the neighbourhood of Xanten, in
which we were induced thus to estimate
what had been gained, since we saw it last,
and from a shore that gradually rises into
the many woody heights around Calcar and
Cleves, the Rhine speedily reaches Rees, a
town on the right bank, built advantageously
at an angle, made by a flexure of the
river to the left.</p>

<p>We landed to view this place, and were
soon persuaded, by the Dutch-like cleanliness
and civility of the people at the inn,
to remain there for the night, rather than to
attempt reaching Emmerick.</p>

<p>Rees is near enough to Holland to have
some of its advantages; and, whatever contempt
it may be natural for English travellers,
at the commencement of their tour, to
feel for Dutch dullness and covetousness,
nothing but some experience of Germany
is necessary to make them rejoice in a return
to the neatness, the civility, the comforts,
quietness, and even the good humour
and intelligence to be easily found in Holland.
Such, at least, was the change, produced
in our minds by a journey from Nimeguen
to Friburg. The lower classes of
the Dutch, and it is the conduct of such
classes, that every where has the chief influence
upon the comforts of others, are not
only without the malignant sullenness of
the Germans, and, therefore, ready to return
you services for money, but are also
much superior to them in intelligence and
docility. Frequent opportunities of gain,
and the habit of comparing them, sharpen
intellects, which might otherwise never be
exercised. In a commercial country, the
humblest persons have opportunities of profiting
by their qualifications; they are,
therefore, in some degree, prepared for better
conditions, and do not feel that angry
envy of others, which arises from the consciousness
of some irremediable distinction.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Rees speak both
Dutch and German; and it was pleasing to
hear at the inn the sulky <i>yaw</i> of the latter
exchanged for the civil <i>Yaw well, Mynheer</i>,
of the Dutch. The town is built chiefly
of brick, like those in Holland; the streets
light; the market-place spacious, and the
houses well preserved. It is of no great
extent, but the space within the walls is
filled, though this must have been sometimes
partly cleared by the sieges, to which
Rees was subject in the war of Philip the
Second upon the Dutch. A few emigrants
from Brussels and Maestricht were now
sheltered in it; but there was no garrison
and no other symptom of its neighbourhood
to the scenes of hostilities, than the
arrival of a Prussian commissary to collect
hay and corn. We were cheered by the
re-appearance of prosperity in a country,
where it is so seldom to be seen, and passed
a better evening in this little town, than in
any other between Friburg and Holland.</p>

<p>In the morning, having no disgust to
impel us, we were somewhat tardy in embarking;
and the boatmen, who had found
out the way of reviving our impatience,
talked of the great distance of Holland, till
they had us on board. Five or six well-looking
villages presently appear after leaving
Rees, the next port to which is Emmerick,
once an Hanseatic town, and still
a place of some dignity, from spires and
towers, but certainly not of much commerce,
for we could not see more than two
vessels on the beach.</p>

<p>This is the town, at which a Governor
and General, appointed by Philip the Second,
with probably half a dozen titles,
asserting his excellence, serenity and honour,
gave an instance of baseness, scarcely ever
exceeded even by Philip himself. Approaching
the place, which was then neutral,
the inhabitants went out to him with
an entreaty, that he would not send troops
into it, and, probably by something more
than entreaty, obtained his promise, that
they should be spared. In spite of this promise,
of the remonstrances of the inhabitants,
and of the representations of a clergyman,
that the Spanish assurances of having engaged
in the war chiefly for the interests
of the Catholic religion could not be credited,
if acts, contrary to the precepts of
all religion, were daily perpetrated; in spite
of these, Mendoza, the Spanish commander,
sent in four hundred troops, but with another
promise, that their number should not
be increased, and with this consolation for
the burgesses, that the Spanish Colonel of
the detachment was directed to swear in
their presence, to admit no more, even if
they should be offered to him.</p>

<p>Mendoza had estimated this man's heart
by his own, and considered his oath only
as a convenient delusion for preventing the
resistance of the inhabitants. He accordingly
sent other troops to him, under the
command of a foreign hireling, and with
a peremptory order for their admission;
but the honest Spaniard gave him this reply,
"Though the General has set the example,
I will not violate my faith."</p>

<p>Passing Emmerick with much pleasure,
we speedily came to the point at which the
Rhine, dividing itself into two streams, loses
its name immediately in the one, and presently
after in the other. Some writer has
compared this merging to the voluntary
surrender of exertions and views, by which
affectionate parents lose themselves in their
children. The stream, which bends to the
west, takes the name of the Waal; that,
which flows in the general direction of the
river, retains its name, for a few miles,
when another stream issues to the northward,
and takes that of the Yssel. The
old river is still recognized, after this separation,
and the town of Rhenen takes its
name from it; but, about a mile lower, it
yields to the denomination of the Leck,
which, like that of the Waal, does not long
enjoy its usurped distinction. The Waal,
or Wahl, being joined by the Maas, as the
Dutch, or the Meuse, as the French call it,
near Bommel, takes the name of that river,
and, soon after, the Leck merges in their
united stream, which carries the title of the
Maas by Rotterdam, Schiedam and Flaarding,
into the German ocean.</p>

<p>We did not yield to this artificial distinction,
so far as to think ourselves taking leave
of the Rhine, or losing the stream, that
had presented to us, at first, features of the
boldest grandeur, mingled with others of
the sweetest beauty, and then borne us safely
past a shore, pressed by the hasty steps of
distress, as well as threatened by those of
ravage from a flying and a pursuing army.
Nor does the river change the character it
has lately assumed; but still passes with an
even, wide and forceful current between
cultivated or pastoral levels, bounded, at
some distance, by gradual, woody ascents.</p>

<p>Among these heights and woods, Cleves
is visible to the left, and those, who see it
only at this distance, may repeat the dictionary
descriptions of its grandeur and consequence
as a capital. Soon after, Schenckenkanze,
a small fort, built on the point of
the long island, round which the Rhine
and the Waal flow, occurs; and then the
southern extremity of the province of
Utrecht. We were glad to see this commencement
of the dominions of the United
States, though the shore opposite to them
was still Prussian; and, telling the boatmen,
if they had occasion to stop at any
town, to touch only upon the free bank,
they humoured us so far as to row out of
the current for the sake of approaching it;
in short, we stepped no more upon German
land; and, within a few miles, were enveloped,
on both sides, by the prospering,
abounding plains of the Dutch provinces.
<i>Italiam! Italiam!</i></p>

<hr class="minimal" />

<p>Early in the afternoon, the lofty tower
of the Belvidere, or prospect-house at Nimeguen,
came in sight; then the bright
pinnacles of the public buildings, and the
high, turf-coloured angles of the fortifications.
The town was thronged with fugitives
from Flanders, but we found sufficient
accommodation, as before, at the inn in
the market-place, and were not in a tone
of spirits to be fastidious about any thing,
heightened as the appearance of prosperity
was to us by contrast, and happy as even
the refugees appeared to be at finding
peace and safety. The mall before the
Prince of Orange's house was filled with
parties of them, as gay as if they had left
their homes in Flanders but for an holiday
excursion.</p>

<p>We were at the Belvidere till evening,
lingering over the rich prospect of probably
forty miles diameter, from Arnheim
and Duisbourg in the north to Cleves and
Guelders in the south, with an eastern view
over half the forests of Guelderland to those
of Westphalia. Such an extent of green
landscape, richly varied with towns, villages
and woods, spreading and gradually ascending
to the horizon, was now almost as novel
to us, as it was placidly beautiful. On the
east, the blue mountainous lines of Germany
broke in upon the reposing character
of the scene.</p>

<p>In the Waal below, two or three vessels
bore the Emperor's flag, and were laden, as
it was said, with some of his <i>regalia</i> from
Flanders. Near them, several bilanders, the
decks of which were covered with awnings,
had attracted spectators to the opposite
bank, for to that side only they were open;
and the company in all were objects of curiosity
to the Dutch, being no less than the
sisterhood of several Flemish convents, in
their proper dresses, and under the care of
their respective abbesses. These ladies had
been thus situated, for several days and
nights, which they had passed on board
their vessels. They were attended by their
usual servants, and remained together, without
going on shore, being in expectation,
as we were told, of invitations to suitable
residences in Germany; but it was then
reported at Nimeguen, that Prince Cobourg
was re-advancing to Brussels, and these societies
had probably their misfortunes increased
by the artifices of a political rumour.
We could not learn, as we wished, that they
had brought away many effects. Their
plate it was needless to enquire about; the
contributions of the preceding spring had
no doubt swallowed up that. Having dismissed
our Cologne watermen, we embarked
upon the Waal, the next day, in a public
boat for Rotterdam; a neat schuyt, well
equipped and navigated, in which, for a
few florins, you have the use of the cabin.
Our voyage, from the want of wind, was
slow enough to shew as much as could be
seen of the Waal; which, at Nimeguen,
runs almost constantly downward, but is
soon met by the tide, and overcome, or, at
least, resisted by it. The breadth, which
varies but little above Bommel, is, to our
recollection, not less than that of the
Thames, at Fulham; the depth, during the
beginning of the same space, is probably
considerable, in the stream, for, even upon
the shore, our dextrous old steersman found
water enough to sweep the rushy bank at
almost every tack, with a boat, drawing
about five feet. The signs of activity in
commerce are astonishing. A small hamlet,
one cannot call any place in Holland contemptible,
or miserable, a hamlet of a dozen
houses has two or three vessels, of twenty
tons each; a village has a herring boat
for almost every house, and a trading vessel
for Rotterdam two or three times a week.
Heavy, high rigged vessels, scarcely breasting
the stream, and fit only for river voyages,
we frequently met; many of them
carrying coals for the nearer part of Germany,
such as we saw on the banks between
Rees and Nimeguen, and, with much pleasure,
recognized for symptoms of neighbourhood
to England.</p>

<p>The first town from Nimeguen, on the
right bank of the Waal, is Thiel, which we
had only time to see was enclosed by modern
fortifications, and was not inferior in
neatness to other Dutch towns, at least not
so in one good street, which we were able
to traverse. A sand bank before the port
has much lessened the trade of the place,
which, in the tenth century, was considerable
enough to be acknowledged by the
Emperor Otto, in the grant of several privileges.</p>

<p>About a league lower, on the opposite
side of the Waal, or rather on the small
island of Voorn, stood formerly a fort, called
Nassau, which the French, in 1672,
utterly destroyed. Near its site, at the
northern extremity of the island of Bommel,
which lies between the Maas and the
Waal, a fort, built by Cardinal Andrew of
Austria, still subsists, under the name of
<i>Fort St. Andr&eacute;</i>. The founder, who built it
upon the model of the citadel of Antwerp,
had no other view than to command by it
the town of Bommel; but, in the year
1600, Prince Maurice of Nassau reduced
the garrison, after a siege of five weeks,
and it has since contributed to protect what
it was raised to destroy, the independence
of the Dutch commonwealth.</p>

<p>In the evening, we came opposite to the
town of Bommel, where we were put on
shore to pass the night and the next day,
being Sunday; the boat proceeded on the
voyage for Rotterdam, but could not reach
it before the next morning.</p>

<p>Bommel is a small town on the edge of
the river, surrounded by wood enough to
make it remarkable in Holland; light, neat
and pretty. The two principal streets cross
each other at right angles, and are without
canals. Being at some distance from the
general roads, it is ill provided with inns;
but one of them has a delightful prospect,
and there is no dirt, or other symptom of
negligence within. The inhabitants are
advanced enough in prosperity and intelligent
curiosity to have two <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s</i>, where
they meet to read new publications; a luxury,
which may be found in almost every
Dutch town. At the ends of the two principal
streets are gates; that towards the
water between very old walls; those on the
land side modern and stronger with drawbridges
over a wide fosse, that nearly surrounds
the town.</p>

<p>On the other side of this ditch are high
and broad embankments, well planted with
trees, and so suitable to be used as public
walks, that we supposed them to have been
raised partly for that purpose, and partly as
defences to the country against water.
They are, however, greater curiosities, having
been thrown up by Prince Maurice in
1599, chiefly because his garrison of four
thousand foot and two thousand horse were
too numerous for the old works; and between
these intrenchments was made what
is thought to have been the first attempt at
a covered way, since improved into a regular
part of fortifications. This was during
the ineffectual siege of three weeks, in
which Mendoza lost two thousand men,
Maurice having then a constant communication
with the opposite bank of the Waal
by means of two bridges of boats, one
above, the other below the town.</p>

<p>Bommel was otherwise extremely important
in the struggle of the Dutch against
Philip. It was once planned to have been
delivered by treachery, but, that being discovered,
the Earl of Mansfeldt, Philip's
commander, raised the siege. It adhered
to the assembly at Dort, though the Earl of
March, the commander of the first armed
force of the Flemings, had committed such
violences in the town, that the Prince of
Orange found it necessary to send him to
prison. In the campaign of 1606, when
Prince Maurice adopted defensive operations,
this was one of the extreme points
of his line, which extended from hence to
Schenck.</p>

<p>The natural honesty of mankind is on
the side of the defensive party, and it is,
therefore, that in reading accounts of sieges
one is always on the side of the besieged.
The Dutch, except when subject to some
extraordinary influence, have been always
defensive in their wars; from their first
astonishing resistance to Philip, to that
against the petty attack, which Charles the
Second incited the Bishop of Munster to
make, who had the coolness to tell Sir
<span class="smallcaps">William Temple</span>, that he had thought
over the probabilities of his enterprise, and,
if it failed, he should not care, for he could
go into Italy and buy a Cardinal's cap;
but that he had first a mind to make some
figure in the world. The territory of the
United Provinces is so small, that, in these
wars, the whole Dutch Nation has been
in little better condition, than that of a
people, besieged in one great town; and
Louis the Fourteenth, in the attempt, which
Charles the Second's wicked sister concerted
between the two Monarchs, sent, for the
first time, to a whole people, a threat, similar
to those sometimes used against a single
town. His declaration of the 24th of June,
1672, after boasting how his "just designs"
and undertakings had prospered, since his
arrival in the army, and how he would treat
the Dutch, if, by submission, they would
"deserve his great goodness," thus proceeds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"On the contrary, all of whatever quality
and condition, who shall refuse to comply
with these offers, and shall resist his
Majesty's forces, either by the inundation
of their dyke, or otherwise, shall be punished
with the utmost rigour. At present,
all hostilities shall be used against those,
who oppose his Majesty's designs; and,
when the ice shall open a passage on all
sides, his Majesty will not give any quarter
to the inhabitants of such cities, but give
order, that their goods be plundered and
their houses burnt."</p>

<p>It is pleasant, in every country, to cherish
the recollections, which make it a spectacle
for the mind as well as the eye, and no
country is enriched by so many as Holland,
not even the West of England, where patriotism
and gratitude hover in remembrance
over the places, endeared by the
steps of our glorious <span class="smallcaps">William</span>.</p>

<p>Bommel is built on a broad projection
of the island of the same name into the
Waal, which thus flows nearly on two sides
of its walls, and must be effectually commanded
by them. But, though it is therefore
important in a military view, and that
the French were now so near to Breda, as
to induce families to fly from thence, whom
we saw at Bommel, yet the latter place was
in no readiness for defence. There was not
a cannon upon the walls, or upon the antient
outworks, which we mistook for terraces,
and not ten soldiers in the place; a
negligence, which was, however, immediately
after remedied.</p>

<p>The Dutch tardiness of exertion has been
often blamed, and, in such instances, deservedly;
but, as to the influence of this
sparingness in their general system of politics
and in former periods, a great deal
more wit than truth has been circulated by
politicians. The chief value of power is
in the known possession of it. Those who
are believed to have exerted it much, will
be attacked, because the exertion may be
supposed to have exhausted the power.
The nation, or the individual, that attempts
to rectify every error and punish every trivial
offence of others, may soon lose, in
worthless contests, the strength, that should
be preserved for resisting the most positive
and unequivocal attacks.</p>

<p>Ministers have appeared in Holland, who
could plan unnecessary contests, and meditate
the baseness, falsely called ambition, of
putting the whole valour and wealth of a
nation into exercise, for the purpose of enforcing
whatever they may have once designed,
or said; and, as there is, perhaps,
no country in Europe, which cannot justly
allege some injury against another, they
have exaggerated the importance of such
injuries, for the purpose of impelling their
own country, by aggravated anger, or fear,
into precipitate hostilities. But the Dutch,
accustoming themselves to as much vigilance,
as confidence, have with-held encouragement
from such artifices, and hence that
general tardiness in beginning wars, which
every politician, capable of an inflammatory
declamation, thinks it wisdom to ridicule.</p>

<p>We left Bommel at seven in the morning,
in a stout, decked sea-boat, well rigged,
and, as appeared, very dextrously navigated.
The wind was directly contrary, and there
are sometimes islands, sometimes shoals in
the Waal, which narrowed the channel to
four or five times the length of the vessel;
yet there was not any failure in tacking,
and the boom was frequently assisted to
traverse by the reeds of the bank, which it
swept. The company in the cabin were
not very numerous, but there was amongst
them at least one lamentable group; the
minister of a Protestant church at Maestricht,
an aged and decrepid gentleman, flying
with his wife and two daughters from
the approaching siege of that place; himself
laid on pillows upon the floor of the cabin;
his daughters attending him; all neglected,
all victims to the glories of war.</p>

<p>The boat soon passed Louvenstein, on
the left bank of the Maese, a brick castellated
building apparently about two centuries
old, surrounded by some modern works,
which render it one of the defences of the
river. Count Byland, the late commander
of Breda, was then imprisoned in this fortress,
which has been long used for state
purposes. Here those friends of Barneveldt
were confined, who derived from it,
and left to their posterity the name of the
Louvenstein party; and hence Grotius, who
was of the number, made his escape, concealed
in a trunk, which the sentinels had
so often seen filled with Arminian books,
that his wife persuaded them they carried
nothing more than their usual cargo.</p>

<p>From Louvenstein, near which the Waal
unites with the Maese, and assumes the
name of that river, we soon reached Gorcum,
where the short stay of the boat permitted
us only to observe the neatness of
the town, and that the fortifications had
the appearance of being strong, though
small, and seemed to be in most exact repair.
This, indeed, is one of the forts
chiefly relied upon by the province of Holland;
for, in 1787, their States made Gorcum
and Naarden the extreme points of
their line of defence, and ordered a dyke
to be thrown across the Linge, which flows
into the Maese at the former place, for the
purpose of overflowing the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>The next town in the voyage is Dort,
formerly one of the most considerable in
Holland, and still eminent for its wealth,
though the trade is diminished by that of
Rotterdam. This is the town, which Dumourier
strove to reach, in the invasion of
1792, and forty thousand stand of arms
were found to have been collected there
for him. Our boat passed before one quarter,
in which the houses rise immediately
over a broad bay of the Maese, with an
air of uncommon gaiety and lightness; but
the evenness of the town prevented us from
seeing more than the part directly nearest.</p>

<p>In the bay was one of those huge timber
floats, the construction of which has been
before described. It was crowded with
visitors from the town; and the wooden
huts upon it, being ornamented with flags,
had the appearance of booths at a fair.
Large as this was, it had been considerably
diminished, since its arrival at Dort, and
several hundreds of the workmen had departed.</p>

<p>A little further on, and within sight of
this joyous company, was the melancholy
reverse of nearly an hundred ladies, driven
from some convent in Flanders, now residing,
like those near Nimeguen, in bilanders
moored to the bank. Their vessels
being open on the side towards the water,
we caught as full a view of them as could
be had without disrespect; and saw that
they still wore their conventual dresses, and
were seated, apparently according to their
ages, at some sort of needle-work. It might
have been censured, a few years since, that
mistakes, or deceptions, as to religious duties,
should have driven them from the
world; but it was certainly now only to be
lamented, that any thing short of the gradual
and peaceful progress of reason should
have expelled them from their retirement.</p>

<p>We reached Rotterdam, in the evening,
and stayed there, the next day, to observe
whether the confidence of the Dutch in
their dykes and fortresses was sufficient to
preserve their tranquillity in a place almost
within hearing of the war, the French being
then besieging Sluys. There was no perceptible
symptom of agitation, or any diminution
of the ordinary means for increasing
wealth. The persons, with whom we conversed,
and they were not a few, spoke of
the transactions of the campaign with almost
as much calmness and curiosity, as if
these had been passing in India. They
could not suppose it possible, that the French
might reach the city; or, if they did, seemed
to rely upon the facility, with which their
property could be removed by the canals
through Leyden and Haerlem, to the shore
of the Zuyder Zee, then across it by sailing
barges, and then again by the canals as far
as Groningen, whither the French would
certainly not penetrate. So valuable was
water thought in Holland, not only as a
means of opulence in peace, but of defence,
or preservative flight in war. An
excessive selfishness, which is the vice of
the Dutch, appeared sometimes to prevent
those, who could fly, from thinking of their
remaining countrymen.</p>

<p>An intention of dispensing with the customary
fair was the only circumstance,
which distinguished this season from others
at Rotterdam, and that was imputed to the
prudence of preventing any very numerous
meetings of the populace.</p>

<p>About three weeks sooner than was necessary,
for it was so long before a convenient
passage occurred, we went from hence
to Helvoetsluys, and there remained, a fortnight,
watching an inflexible north-westerly
wind, and listening to accounts but too
truly certified of French frigates and privateers,
almost unopposed in those latitudes.
Lloyd's List brought the names of five, or
seven, French ships, then known to be
cruising in the north; and one packet was
delayed in its voyage by the sight of several
Dutch vessels, set on fire within a few
leagues of <i>Goree</i>. The Dutch lamented,
that the want of seamen crippled the operations
of their Admiralty Board: an Englishman,
who was proud to deny, that any
such want, or want in such a degree, existed,
as to his country, was reduced to silence and
shame, when it was enquired: Why, then,
have these seas been, for twelve months, thus
exposed to the dominion of the French?</p>

<p>At length, a convoy arrived for a noble
family, and we endeavoured to take the
benefit of it by embarking in a packet,
which sailed at the same time; but the
sloop of war was unable to pass over what
are called the Flats, and our captain had
resolved to proceed without it, notwithstanding
the contrarieties of the wind;
when, with much joy, we discerned a small
boat, and knew it to be English by the
skilful impetuosity of the rowers. Having
induced the people of the packet to make a
signal, by paying them for the passage to
Harwich, we were fortunately taken on
board this boat, at the distance of about
three leagues from Helvoetsluys, and soon
re-landed at that place; the packet proceeding
on her voyage, which, supposing no
interruption from the French vessels, was
not likely to be made in less than three
days. We rejoiced at the release from
fatigue and from fear, at least, if not from
danger; and, seeing little probability of an
immediate passage, returned, the next day,
to Rotterdam, with the hope of finding
some neutral vessel, bound to an English
port.</p>

<p>We were immediately gratified by the
promise of an American captain to meet us
with his vessel at Helvoetsluys, and, the
next day, had a delightful voyage thither,
in a hired yacht, partly by the Maese, and
partly by channels inaccessible to large
vessels.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="FLAARDING" id="FLAARDING">FLAARDING.</a></h3>

<p>The Maese presently brought us
opposite to this small port, the metropolis
of the herring fishers; rendered interesting
by the patient industry and useful courage
of its inhabitants. We landed at it, but
saw only what was immediately open for
observation. Like most of the Dutch towns,
on the banks of rivers, it is protected from
floods by standing at the distance of three
or four hundred yards from the shore, and
communicates with the stream only by a
narrow, but deep canal. The best street is
built upon the quays of this channel, on
which the herring boats deposit their cargoes
before the doors of the owners. We
did not see more than fifty, a great number
being then at sea. Except the business
in this street, and the smell of herrings,
which prevailed every where, there was
nothing to shew that we were in a place
supported solely by the industry of fishermen;
no neglected houses, no cottages,
no dirty streets, no inferiority, in point of
neatness and brightness, to the other towns
of Holland.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are remarkable for adhering
to the dress, as well as the employments
of their ancestors; so much so, that
their clothing is mentioned in other towns
as the representation of the antient national
dress, common throughout all the provinces
two centuries since; and it is certain,
that their appearance is exactly such as is
delineated in pictures of that date.</p>

<hr class="minimal" />

<p>Some miles further, we entered the old
Maese, a channel in several parts very narrow,
and evidently preserved by art, but
in others nobly expansive, and filled almost
to the level of the luxuriant pastures and
groves that border it. In one part, where
the antient stream takes a circuitous course,
a canal has been cut, that shortens the voyage,
for light vessels, by several miles, and
barks in one channel are sometimes visible
from the other, their sails swelling over
fields, in which, at a distance, no water is
discernible. Neat and substantial farmhouses,
with meadows flaming from them
to the river, frequently occurred; and there
were more appearances of the careful labours,
peculiar to the Dutch, than in the
great Maese itself, the banks being occasionally
supported, like their dykes, by a
compact basket-work of flags and faggots.</p>

<p>Passing many small villages, or hamlets,
we came, at sun-set, to the large branch of
the sea, which spreads from Williamstadt to
Helvoetsluys, and from thence to the German
ocean. The former fortress was faintly
visible at a great distance over the water;
and, while we were straining our sight towards
it, there was proof enough of a nearness
to the present theatre of war, the
sounds of the siege of Sluys coming loudly
and distinctly in the breeze. The characters
of evening had fallen upon the scene
in mild and deep solemnity; but the glories
of nature were unfelt, while a dreadful
estimation of the miseries, produced at each
return of the sullen roar, pressed almost exclusively
upon the mind; considerations,
which were soon after prolonged by the
melancholy view of several English transports,
filled with wounded soldiers, whose
blythe music, now at the firing of the evening
gun, was rendered painful by its contrast
to the truth of their conditions.</p>

<p>At Helvoetsluys, nothing was to be
heard, but accounts, derived from many
respectable officers, on their way to England,
of the unexampled difficulties borne,
cheerfully borne, by the British army, within
the last three months, and deservedly
mentioned, not as complaints, but as proofs
of their firmness. There were, however,
mingled with these, many reports as to the
contrary conduct even of those continental
troops, which still kept the field with us;
of their tardiness, their irregularity, of the
readiness with which they permitted the
British to assume all the dangers of attacks,
and of their little co-operation even in the
means of general resistance. <i>Brave Anglois!
Brave Anglois!</i> was the constant shout of
these troops, when they had recourse to the
British to regain the posts themselves had
just lost, or to make some assault, which
they had refused, or had attempted with
ineffectual formality. They would then
follow our troops, and, when an advantage
was gained, seemed to think they had share
enough of the victory, if they were at hand
to continue the slaughter of the retreating,
and to engross all the plunder of the dead.</p>

<p>We were as glad to escape from such
considerations, as from the crowded inns
of Helvoetsluys, now little more convenient
than ships; and, the next morning, embarked
on board the American vessel, then
arrived from Rotterdam. A fair wind soon
wafted us out of sight of the low coast of
Holland; but we were afterwards becalmed,
and carried by tides so far towards the
Flemish shore as to have the firing before
Sluys not only audible, but terribly loud.
For part of three days, we remained within
hearing of this noise; but did not, therefore,
think ourselves very distant from the
English coast, knowing that the fire, at the
preceding siege of Nieuport, had been
heard as far as the Downs; Nieuport, the
wretched scene of so many massacres, and
of distress, which, in Holland, had been
forcibly described to us by eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>So keenly, indeed were the horrors of
this place conceived by those, who personally
escaped from them, that of the
emigrants, rescued by the intrepidity of our
seamen, many suppressed all joy at their
own deliverance by lamentations for the
fate of their brethren. One gentleman was
no sooner on board a ship, then exposed to
the batteries on shore, than he climbed the
shrouds and remained aloft, notwithstanding
all entreaties, till a severe wound obliged
him to descend. Another, who had been
saved from the beach by a young sailor,
was unable to swim so far as the ship;
and the honest lad, having taken him upon
his back, struggled hard amidst a shower of
balls to save both their lives. At length,
he, too, began to falter; and the weakness
of his efforts, not his complaints, seemed
to shew his companion, that one, or both
of them, must perish: the latter nobly asked
the lad, whether he could save his own
life, if left to himself; and, receiving a reluctant
reply, that probably he might do
so, but that he would strive for both, the
emigrant instantly plunged into the ocean
and was seen no more. The glorious sailor
reached his ship, just as he began again to
sail, and was saved.</p>

<p>The calm continued during the day, and
the sun set with uncommon grandeur among
clouds of purple, red and gold, that mingling
with the serene azure of the upper
sky, composed a richness and harmony of
colouring which we never saw surpassed.
It was most interesting to watch the progress
of evening and its effect on the waters;
streaks of light scattered among the
dark western clouds, after the sun had set,
and gleaming in long reflection on the sea,
while a grey obscurity was drawing over
the east, as the vapours rose gradually from
the ocean. The air was breathless; the tall
sails of the vessel were without motion,
and her course upon the deep scarcely perceptible;
while, above, the planet Jupiter
burned with steady dignity, and threw a
tremulous line of light on the sea, whose
surface flowed in smooth waveless expanse.
Then, other planets appeared, and countless
stars spangled the dark waters. Twilight
now pervaded air and ocean, but the
west was still luminous, where one solemn
gleam of dusky red edged the horizon, from
under heavy vapours.</p>

<p>It was now that we first discovered some
symptoms of England; the lighthouse
on the South-Foreland appeared like a
dawning star above the margin of the sea.</p>

<p>The vessel made little progress during
the night. With the earliest dawn of
morning we were on deck, in the hope of
seeing the English coast; but the mists
veiled it from our view. A spectacle,
however, the most grand in nature, repaid
us for our disappointment, and we found
the circumstances of a sun-rise at sea, yet
more interesting than those of a sun-set.
The moon, bright and nearly at her meridian,
shed a strong lustre on the ocean, and
gleamed between the sails upon the deck;
but the dawn, beginning to glimmer, contended
with her light, and, soon touching
the waters with a cold grey tint, discovered
them spreading all round to the vast horizon.
Not a sound broke upon the silence,
except the lulling one occasioned by the
course of the vessel through the waves, and
now and then the drowsy song of the pilot,
as he leaned on the helm; his shadowy
figure just discerned, and that of a sailor
pacing near the head of the ship with
crossed arms and a rolling step. The captain,
wrapt in a sea-coat, lay asleep on the
deck, wearied with the early watch. As
the dawn strengthened, it discovered white
sails stealing along the distance, and the
flight of some sea-fowls, as they uttered their
slender cry, and then, dropping upon the
waves, sat floating on the surface. Meanwhile,
the light tints in the east began to
change, and the skirts of a line of clouds
below to assume a hue of tawny red, which
gradually became rich orange and purple.
We could now perceive a long tract of the
coast of France, like a dark streak of vapour
hovering in the south, and were somewhat
alarmed on finding ourselves within view
of the French shore, while that of England
was still invisible.</p>

<p>The moon-light faded fast from the
waters, and soon the long beams of the sun
shot their lines upwards through the clouds
and into the clear blue sky above, and all
the sea below glowed with fiery reflections,
for a considerable time, before his disk appeared.
At length he rose from the waves,
looking from under clouds of purple and
gold; and as he seemed to touch the water,
a distant vessel passed over his disk, like a
dark speck.</p>

<hr class="minimal" />

<p>We were soon after cheered by the
faintly seen coast of England, but at the
same time discovered, nearer to us on the
south-west, the high blue headlands of Calais;
and, more eastward, the town, with
its large church and the steeples of two
others, seated on the edge of the sea. The
woods, that fringe the summits of hills
rising over it, were easily distinguished with
glasses, as well as the national flag on the
steeple of the great church. As we proceeded,
Calais cliffs, at a considerable distance
westward of the town, lost their a&euml;rial
blue, and shewed an high front of chalky
precipice, overtopped by dark downs. Beyond,
far to the south-west, and at the foot
of a bold promontory, that swelled above
all the neighbouring heights, our glasses
gave us the towers and ramparts of Boulogne,
sloping upward from the shore, with
its tall lighthouse on a low point running
out into the sea; the whole appearing with
considerable dignity and picturesque effect.
The hills beyond were tamer, and sunk
gradually away in the horizon. At length,
the breeze wafting us more to the north,
we discriminated the bolder features of the
English coast, and, about noon, found ourselves
nearly in the middle of the channel,
having Picardy on our left and Kent on the
right, its white cliffs aspiring with great
majesty over the flood. The sweeping bay
of Dover, with all its chalky heights, soon
after opened. The town appeared low on
the shore within, and the castle, with round
and massy towers, crowned the vast rock,
which, advancing into the sea, formed the
eastern point of the crescent, while Shakespeare's
cliff, bolder still and sublime as the
eternal name it bears, was the western promontory
of the bay. The height and grandeur
of this cliff were particularly striking,
when a ship was seen sailing at its base,
diminished by comparison to an inch.
From hence the cliffs towards Folkstone,
though still broken and majestic, gradually
decline. There are, perhaps, few prospects
of sea and shore more animated and magnificent
than this. The vast expanse of
water, the character of the cliffs, that guard
the coast, the ships of war and various merchantmen
moored in the Downs, the lighter
vessels skimming along the channel, and
the now distant shore of France, with Calais
glimmering faintly, and hinting of different
modes of life and a new world, all these
circumstances formed a scene of pre-eminent
combination, and led to interesting
reflection.</p>

<p>Our vessel was bound to Deal, and,
leaving Dover and its cliffs on the south,
we entered that noble bay, which the rich
shores of Kent open for the sea. Gentle
hills, swelling all round from the water,
green with woods, or cultivation, and
speckled with towns and villages, with now
and then the towers of an old fortress,
offered a landscape particularly cheering to
eyes accustomed to the monotonous flatness
of Dutch views. And we landed in England
under impressions of delight more varied
and strong than can be conceived,
without referring to the joy of an escape
from districts where there was scarcely an
home for the natives, and to the love of
our own country, greatly enhanced by all
that had been seen of others.</p>

<p>Between Deal and London, after being
first struck by the superior appearance and
manners of the people to those of the countries
we had been lately accustomed to, a
contrast too obvious as well as too often remarked
to be again insisted upon, but
which made all the ordinary circumstances
of the journey seem new and delightful,
the difference between the landscapes of
England and Germany occurred forcibly
to notice. The large scale, in which every
division of land appeared in Germany, the
long corn grounds, the huge stretches of
hills, the vast plains and the wide vallies
could not but be beautifully opposed by the
varieties and undulations of English surface,
with gently swelling slopes, rich in verdure,
thick enclosures, woods, bowery hop-grounds,
sheltered mansions, announcing
the wealth, and substantial farms, with neat
villages, the comfort of the country. English
landscape may be compared to cabinet
pictures, delicately beautiful and highly finished;
German scenery to paintings for a
vestibule, of bold outline and often sublime,
but coarse and to be viewed with advantage
only from a distance.</p>

<p>Northward, beyond London, we may
make one stop, after a country, not otherwise
necessary to be noticed, to mention
Hardwick, in Derbyshire, a seat of the
Duke of Devonshire, once the residence of
the Earl of Shrewsbury, to whom Elizabeth
deputed the custody of the unfortunate
Mary. It stands on an easy height, a few
miles to the left of the road from Mansfield
to Chesterfield, and is approached through
shady lanes, which conceal the view of it,
till you are on the confines of the park.
Three towers of hoary grey then rise with
great majesty among old woods, and their
summits appear to be covered with the
lightly shivered fragments of battlements,
which, however, are soon discovered to be
perfectly carved open work, in which the
letters E. S. frequently occur under a coronet,
the initials, and the memorials of the
vanity, of Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury,
who built the present edifice. Its tall
features, of a most picturesque tint, were
finely disclosed between the luxuriant woods
and over the lawns of the park, which,
every now and then, let in a glimpse of the
Derbyshire hills. The scenery reminded us
of the exquisite descriptions of Harewood,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
"The deep embowering shades, that veil Elfrida;"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and those of Hardwick once veiled a form
as lovely as the ideal graces of the Poet,
and conspired to a fate more tragical than
that, which Harewood witnessed.</p>

<p>In front of the great gates of the castle
court, the ground, adorned by old oaks,
suddenly sinks to a darkly shadowed glade,
and the view opens over the vale of Scarsdale,
bounded by the wild mountains of
the Peak. Immediately to the left of the
present residence, some ruined features of
the antient one, enwreathed with the rich
drapery of ivy, give an interest to the scene,
which the later, but more historical structure
heightens and prolongs. We followed,
not without emotion, the walk, which
Mary had so often trodden, to the folding
doors of the great hall, whose lofty grandeur,
aided by silence and seen under the
influence of a lowering sky, suited the temper
of the whole scene. The tall windows,
which half subdue the light they admit,
just allowed us to distinguish the large
figures in the tapestry, above the oak wainscoting,
and shewed a colonnade of oak supporting
a gallery along the bottom of the
hall, with a pair of gigantic elk's horns
flourishing between the windows opposite
to the entrance. The scene of Mary's arrival
and her feelings upon entering this
solemn shade came involuntarily to the
mind; the noise of horses' feet and many
voices from the court; her proud yet gentle
and melancholy look, as, led by my
Lord Keeper, she passed slowly up the hall;
his somewhat obsequious, yet jealous and
vigilant air, while, awed by her dignity and
beauty, he remembers the terrors of his
own Queen; the silence and anxiety of her
maids, and the bustle of the surrounding
attendants.</p>

<p>From the hall a stair-case ascends to the
gallery of a small chapel, in which the
chairs and cushions, used by Mary, still
remain, and proceeds to the first story,
where only one apartment bears memorials
of her imprisonment, the bed, tapestry and
chairs having been worked by herself. This
tapestry is richly embossed with emblematic
figures, each with its title worked above it,
and, having been scrupulously preserved, is
still entire and fresh.</p>

<p>Over the chimney of an adjoining
dining-room, to which, as well as to other
apartments on this floor, some modern furniture
has been added, is this motto carved
in oak:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There is only this: To fear God and keep
his Commandments."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much less valuable was timber than
workmanship, when this mansion was constructed,
that, where the stair-cases are not
of stone, they are formed of solid oaken
steps, instead of planks; such is that from
the second, or state story to the roof,
whence, on clear days, York and Lincoln
Cathedrals are said to be included in the
extensive prospect. This second floor is
that, which gives its chief interest to the
edifice. Nearly all the apartments of it
were allotted to Mary; some of them for
state purposes; and the furniture is known
by other proofs, than its appearance, to remain
as she left it. The chief room, or
that of audience, is of uncommon loftiness,
and strikes by its grandeur, before the veneration
and tenderness arise, which its antiquities,
and the plainly told tale of the
sufferings they witnessed, excite.</p>

<p>The walls, which are covered to a considerable
height with tapestry, are painted
above with historical groups. The chairs
are of black velvet, nearly concealed by a
raised needle-work of gold, silver and colours,
that mingle with surprising richness,
and remain in fresh preservation. The upper
end of the room is distinguished by a
lofty canopy of the same materials, and by
steps which support two chairs; so that the
Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury probably
enjoyed their own stateliness here, as well
as assisted in the ceremonies practised before
Mary. A carpeted table, in front of the
canopy, was, perhaps, the desk of Commissioners,
or Secretaries, who here recorded
some of the proceedings concerning her;
below which, the room breaks into a spacious
recess, where a few articles of furniture
are deposited, not originally placed in
it; a bed of state, used by Mary, the curtains
of gold tissue, but in so tattered a condition,
that its original texture can scarcely
be perceived. This and the chairs, which
accompany it, are supposed to have been
much earlier than Mary's time.</p>

<p>A short passage leads from the state
apartment to her own chamber, a small
room, overlooked from the passage by a
window, which enabled her attendants to
know, that she was contriving no means of
escape through the others into the court.
The bed and chairs of this room are of
black velvet, embroidered by herself; the
toilet of gold tissue; all more decayed than
worn, and probably used only towards the
conclusion of her imprisonment here, when
she was removed from some better apartment,
in which the antient bed, now in the
state-room, had been placed. The date
1599 is once or twice inscribed in this
chamber; for no reason, that could relate
to Mary, who was removed hence in 1584,
and fell, by the often-blooded hands of
Elizabeth, in 1587.</p>

<p>These are the apartments, distinguished
by having been the residence of so unhappy
a personage. On the other side of the
mansion, a grand gallery occupies the length
of the whole front, which is 165 feet, and
contains many portraits, now placed carelessly
on chairs, or the floor; amongst them
an head of Sir Thomas More, apparently
very fine; heads of Henries the Fourth,
Seventh and Eighth; a portrait of Lady
Jane Gray, meek and fair, before a harpsichord,
on which a psalm-book is opened;
at the bottom of the gallery, Elizabeth, slyly
proud and meanly violent; and, at the top,
Mary, in black, taken a short time before
her death, her countenance much faded,
deeply marked by indignation and grief,
and reduced as if to the spectre of herself,
frowning with suspicion upon all who approached
it; the black eyes looking out
from their corners, thin lips, somewhat
aquiline nose and beautiful chin.</p>

<p>What remains of the more antient building
is a ruin, which, standing nearly on
the brink of the glade, is a fine object from
this. A few apartments, though approached
with difficulty through the fragments of
others, are still almost entire, and the dimensions
of that called the Giant's Chamber
are remarkable for the beauty of their
proportion.</p>

<p>From Hardwick to within a few miles of
Middleton, the beauty of the country declines,
while the sublimity is not perfected;
but, from the north-west brow of Brampton
Moor, the vast hills of Derbyshire appear,
in wild and ghastly succession. Middleton,
hewn out of the grey rocks, that impend over
it, and scarcely distinguishable from them, is
worth notice for its very small and neat octagon
church, built partly by brief and partly
by a donation from the Duke of Devonshire.
The valley, or rather chasm, at the entrance
of which it stands, is called Middleton Dale,
and runs, for two miles, between perpendicular
walls of rock, which have more the
appearance of having been torn asunder by
some convulsive rent of the earth, than any
we have elsewhere seen. The strata are
horizontal, and the edges of each are often
distinct and rounded; one of the characteristics
of granite. Three grey rocks, resembling
castles, project from these solid
walls, and, now and then, a lime-kiln,
round like a bastion, half involves in smoke
a figure, who, standing on the summit,
looks the Witch of the Dale, on an edge
of her cauldron, watching the workings of
incantation.</p>

<p>The chasm opened, at length, to a hill,
whence wild moorish mountains were seen
on all sides, some entirely covered with
the dull purple of heath, others green, but
without enclosures, except sometimes a stone
wall, and the dark sides of others marked
only by the blue smoke of weeds, driven
in circles near the ground.</p>

<p>Towards sun-set, from a hill in Cheshire,
we had a vast view over part of that county
and nearly all Lancashire, a scene of fertile
plains and gentle heights, till some broad
and towering mountains, at an immense
distance, were but uncertainly distinguished
from the clouds. Soon after, the cheerful
populousness of the rich towns and villages
in Lancashire supplied objects for attention
of a different character; Stockport first,
crowded with buildings and people, as
much so as some of the busiest quarters in
London, with large blazing fires in every
house, by the light of which women were
frequently spinning, and manufacturers issuing
from their workshops and filling the
steep streets, which the chaise rolled down
with; dangerous rapidity; then an almost
continued street of villages to Manchester,
some miles before which the road was busy
with passengers and carriages, as well as
bordered by handsome country houses; and,
finally for this day, Manchester itself; a
second London; enormous to those, who
have not seen the first, almost tumultuous
with business, and yet well proved to afford
the necessary peacefulness to science, letters
and taste. And not only for itself may
Manchester be an object of admiration, but
for the contrast of its useful profits to the
wealth of a neighbouring place, immersed
in the dreadful guilt of the Slave Trade,
with the continuance of which to believe
national prosperity compatible, is to hope,
that the actions of nations pass unseen before
the Almighty, or to suppose extenuation
of crimes by increase of criminality,
and that the eternal laws of right and
truth, which smite the wickedness of individuals,
are too weak to struggle with the
accumulated and comprehensive guilt of a
national participation in robbery, cruelty
and murder.</p>

<p>From Manchester to Lancaster the road
leads through a pleasant and populous country,
which rises gradually as it approaches
the huge hills we had noticed in the distance
from the brow of Cheshire, and whose
attitudes now resembled those of the Rheingau
as seen from Mentz. From some moors
on this side of Lancaster the prospects open
very extensively over a rich tract fading
into blue ridges; while, on the left, long
lines of distant sea appear, every now and
then, over the dark woods of the shore,
with vessels sailing as if on their summits.
But the view from a hill descending to
Lancaster is pre-eminent for grandeur, and
comprehends an extent of sea and land, and
a union of the sublime in both, which we
have never seen equalled. In the green vale
of the Lune below lies the town, spreading
up the side of a round hill overtopped by
the old towers of the castle and the church.
Beyond, over a ridge of gentle heights,
which bind the west side of the vale, the
noble inlet of the sea, that flows upon the
Ulverston and Lancaster sands, is seen at
the feet of an amphitheatre formed by nearly
all the mountains of the Lakes; an exhibition
of alpine grandeur, both in form
and colouring, which, with the extent of
water below, compose a scenery perhaps
faintly rivalling that of the Lake of Geneva.
To the south and west, the Irish Channel
finishes the view.</p>

<p>The antient town and castle of Lancaster
have been so often and so well described,
that little remains to be said of them. To
the latter considerable additions are building
in the Gothic style, which, when time
shall have shaded the stone, will harmonize
well wish the venerable towers and gatehouse
of the old structure. From a turret
rising over the leads of the castle, called
John o' Gaunt's Chair, the prospect is still
finer than from the terrace of the church-yard
below. Overlooking the Lune and its
green slopes, the eye ranges to the bay of
the sea beyond, and to the Cumberland and
Lancashire mountains. On an island near
the extremity of the peninsula of Low Furness,
the double point of Peel Castle starts
up from the sea, but is so distant that it resembles
a forked rock. This peninsula,
which separates the bay of Ulverston from
the Irish Channel, swells gradually into a
pointed mountain called Blackcomb, thirty
miles from Lancaster, the first in the amphitheatre,
that binds the bay. Hence a
range of lower, but more broken and forked
summits, extends northward to the fells
of High Furness, rolled behind each other,
huge, towering and dark; then, higher still,
Langdale Pikes, with a confusion of other
fells, that crown the head of Windermere
and retire towards Keswick, whose gigantic
mountains, Helvellyn and Saddleback, are,
however, sunk in distance below the horizon
of the nearer ones. The top of Skiddaw
may be discerned when the air is clear,
but it is too far off to appear with dignity.
From Windermere-Fells the heights soften
towards the Vale of Lonsdale, on the east
side of which Ingleborough, a mountain in
Craven, rears his rugged front, the loftiest
and most majestic in the scene. The nearer
country, from this point of the landscape,
is intersected with cultivated hills, between
which the Lune winds its bright but shallow
stream, falling over a weir and passing
under a very handsome stone bridge at the
entrance of the town, in its progress towards
the sea. A ridge of rocky eminences shelters
Lancaster on the east, whence they decline
into the low and uninteresting country, that
stretches to the Channel.</p>

<p>The appearance of the northern Fells is
ever changing with the weather and shifting
lights. Sometimes they resemble those
evening clouds on the horizon, that catch
the last gleams of the sun; at others, wrapt
in dark mist, they are only faintly traced,
and seem like stormy vapours rising from
the sea. But in a bright day their appearance
is beautiful; then, their grand
outlines are distinctly drawn upon the sky,
a vision of Alps; the rugged sides are faintly
marked with light and shadow, with
wood and rock, and here and there a cluster
of white cottages, or farms and hamlets,
gleam at their feet along the water's edge.
Over the whole landscape is then drawn a
softening azure, or sometimes a purple hue,
exquisitely lovely, while the sea below reflects
a brighter tint of blue.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="FROM_LANCASTER_TO_KENDAL" id="FROM_LANCASTER_TO_KENDAL">FROM LANCASTER TO KENDAL.</a></h3>

<p>Leaving Lancaster, we wound along
the southern brow of the vale of the Lune,
which there serpentizes among meadows,
and is soon after shut up between steep
shrubby banks. From the heights we had
some fine retrospects of Lancaster and the
distant sea; but, about three miles from the
town, the hills open forward to a view as
much distinguished by the notice of Mr.
<span class="smallcaps">Gray</span>, as by its own charms. We here
looked down over a woody and finely
broken fore-ground upon the Lune and the
vale of Lonsdale, undulating in richly cultivated
slopes, with Ingleborough, for the
back-ground, bearing its bold promontory
on high, the very crown and paragon of
the landscape. To the west, the vale winds
from sight among smoother hills; and the
gracefully falling line of a mountain, on the
left, forms, with the wooded heights, on
the right, a kind of frame for the distant
picture.</p>

<p>The road now turned into the sweetly
retired vale of Caton, and by the village
church-yard, in which there is not a single
gravestone, to Hornby, a small straggling
town, delightfully seated near the entrance
of the vale of Lonsdale. Its thin toppling
castle is seen among wood, at a considerable
distance, with a dark hill rising over it.
What remains of the old edifice is a square
grey building, with a slender watch-tower,
rising in one corner, like a feather in a hat,
which joins the modern mansion of white
stone, and gives it a singular appearance, by
seeming to start from the centre of its roof.</p>

<p>In front, a steep lawn descends between
avenues of old wood, and the park extends
along the skirts of the craggy hill, that
towers above. At its foot, is a good stone
bridge over the Wenning, now shrunk in
its pebbly bed, and, further on, near the
castle, the church, shewing a handsome
octagonal tower, crowned with battlements.
The road then becomes extremely interesting,
and, at Melling, a village on a brow
some miles further, the view opens over the
whole vale of Lonsdale. The eye now
passes, beneath the arching foliage of some
trees in the fore-ground, to the sweeping
valley, where meadows of the most vivid
green and dark woods, with white cottages
and villages peeping from among them,
mingle with surprising richness, and undulate
from either bank of the Lune to the
feet of hills. Ingleborough, rising from elegantly
swelling ground, overlooked this enchanting
vale, on the right, clouds rolling
along its broken top, like smoke from a
cauldron, and its hoary tint forming a
boundary to the soft verdure and rich woodlands
of the slopes, at its feet. The perspective
was terminated by the tall peeping
heads of the Westmoreland fells, the nearer
ones tinged with faintest purple, the more
distant with light azure; and this is the
general boundary to a scene, in the midst of
which, enclosed between nearer and lower
hills, lies the vale of Lonsdale, of a character
mild, delicate and reposing, like the
countenance of a Madona.</p>

<p>Descending Melling brow, and winding
among the perpetually-changing scenery of
the valley, we approached Ingleborough;
and it was interesting to observe the lines
of its bolder features gradually strengthening,
and the shadowy markings of its minuter
ones becoming more distinct, as we
advanced. Rock and grey crags looked out
from the heath, on every side; but its form
on each was very different. Towards
Lonsdale, the mountain is bold and majestic,
rising in abrupt and broken precipices,
and, often impending, till, at the summit, it
suddenly becomes flat, and is level for nearly
a mile, whence it descends, in along
gradual ridge, to Craven in Yorkshire. In
summer, some festivities are annually celebrated
on this top, and the country people,
as they "drink the freshness of the mountain
breeze <span class="small"><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></span><a name="fn1r" id="fn1r"></a>," look over the wild moorlands
of Yorkshire, the rich vales of Lancashire,
and to the sublime mountains of
Westmoreland.</p>

<p>Crossing a small bridge, we turned from
Ingleborough, and passed very near the antient
walls of Thirlham Castle, little of
which is now remaining. The ruin is on
a green broken knoll, one side of which is
darkened with brush-wood and dwarf-oak.
Cattle were reposing in the shade, on the
bank of a rivulet, that rippled through what
was formerly the castle ditch. A few old
trees waved over what was once a tower,
now covered with ivy.</p>

<p>Some miles further, we crossed the Leck,
a shrunk and desolate stream, nearly choked
with pebbles, winding in a deep rocky glen,
where trees and shrubs marked the winter
boundary of the waters. Our road, mounting
a green eminence of the opposite bank,
on which stands Overborough, the handsome
modern mansion of Mr. <span class="smallcaps">Fenwick</span>,
wound between plantations and meadows,
painted with yellow and purple flowers,
like those of spring. As we passed through
their gentle slopes, we had, now and then,
sweet views between the foliage, on the
left, into the vale of Lonsdale, now contracting
in its course, and winding into
ruder scenery. Among these catches, the
best picture was, perhaps, where the white
town of Kirby Lonsdale shelves along the
opposite bank, having rough heathy hills
immediately above it, and, below, a venerable
Gothic bridge over the Lune, rising in
tall arches, like an antient aqueduct; its
grey tint agreeing well with the silvery
lightness of the water and the green shades,
that flourished from the steep margin over
the abutments.</p>

<p>The view from this bridge, too, was
beautiful. The river, foaming below among
masses of dark rock, variegated with light
tints of grey, as if touched by the painter's
pencil, withdrew towards the south in a
straight channel, with the woods of Overborough
on the left. The vale, dilating,
opened a long perspective to Ingleborough
and many blue mountains more distant,
with all the little villages we had passed,
glittering on the intervening eminences.
The colouring of some low hills, on the
right, was particularly beautiful, long shades
of wood being overtopped with brown
heath, while, below, meadows of soft verdure
fell gently towards the river bank.</p>

<p>Kirby Lonsdale, a neat little town, commanding
the whole vale, is on the western
steep. We staid two hours at it, gratified
by witnessing, at the first inn we reached,
the abundance of the country and the
goodwill of the people. In times, when
the prices of necessary articles are increasing
with the taste for all unnecessary display,
instances of cheapness may be to persons of
small incomes something more than mere
physical treasures; they have a moral value
in contributing to independence of mind.</p>

<p>Here we had an early and, as it afterwards
appeared, a very exaggerated specimen
of the dialect of the country. A woman
talked, for five minutes, against our
window, of whose conversation we could
understand scarcely a word. Soon after, a
boy replied to a question, "<i>I do na ken</i>,"
and "<i>gang</i>" was presently the common
word for <i>go</i>; symptoms of nearness to a
country, which we did not approach, without
delighting to enumerate the instances of
genius and worth, that adorn it.</p>

<p>Leaving Kirby Lonsdale by the Kendal
road, we mounted a steep hill, and, looking
back from its summit upon the whole vale
of Lonsdale, perceived ourselves to be in the
mid-way between beauty and desolation, so
enchanting was the retrospect and so wild
and dreary the prospect. From the neighbourhood
of Caton to Kirby the ride was
superior, for elegant beauty, to any we had
passed; this from Kirby to Kendal is of a
character distinctly opposite. After losing
sight of the vale, the road lies, for nearly
the whole distance, over moors and perpetually
succeeding hills, thinly covered
with dark purple heath flowers, of which
the most distant seemed black. The dreariness
of the scene was increased by a heavy
rain and by the slowness of our progress,
jostling amongst coal carts, for ten miles of
rugged ground. The views over the Westmoreland
mountains were, however, not
entirely obscured; their vast ridges were
visible in the horizon to the north and
west, line over line, frequently in five or
six ranges. Sometimes the intersecting
mountains opened to others beyond, that
fell in deep and abrupt precipices, their profiles
drawing towards a point below and
seeming to sink in a bottomless abyss.</p>

<p>On our way over these wilds, parts of
which are called Endmoor and Cowbrows,
we overtook only long trains of coal carts,
and, after ten miles of bleak mountain road,
began to desire a temporary home, somewhat
sooner than we perceived Kendal,
white-smoking in the dark vale. As we
approached, the outlines of its ruinous castle
were just distinguishable through the gloom,
scattered in masses over the top of a small
round hill, on the right. At the entrance
of the town, the river Kent dashed in foam
down a weir; beyond it, on a green slope,
the gothic tower of the church was half
hid by a cluster of dark trees; gray fells
glimmered in the distance.</p>

<p>We were lodged at another excellent
inn, and, the next morning, walked over
the town, which has an air of trade mingled
with that of antiquity. Its history has
been given in other places, and we are not
able to discuss the doubt, whether it was
the Roman <i>Brocanonacio</i>, or not. The manufacture
of cloth, which our statute books
testify to have existed as early as the reign
in which <i>Falstaff</i> is made to allude to it,
appears to be still in vigour, for the town is
surrounded, towards the river, with dyeing-grounds.
We saw, however, no shades of
"Kendal green," or, indeed, any but bright
scarlet.</p>

<p>The church is remarkable for three
chapels, memorials of the antient dignity of
three neighbouring families the Bellinghams,
Stricklands and Parrs. These are enclosures,
on each side of the altar, differing
from pews chiefly in being large enough to
contain tombs. Mr. Gray noticed them
minutely in the year 1769. They were
then probably entire; but the wainscot or
railing, which divided the chapel of the
Parrs from the aisle, is now gone. Of
two stone tombs in it one is enclosed with
modern railing, and there are many remnants
of painted arms on the adjoining
windows. The chapel of the Stricklands,
which is between this and the altar, is separated
from the church aisle by a solid wainscot,
to the height of four feet, and after
that by a wooden railing with broken fillagree
ornaments. That of the Bellinghams
contains an antient tomb, of which the
brass plates, that bore inscriptions and arms,
are now gone, but some traces of the latter
remain in plaistered stone at the side. Over
it, are the fragments of an helmet, and, in
the roof, those of armorial bearings, carved
in wood. On a pillar, near this, is an
inscription, almost obliterated, in which the
following words may yet be traced:</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
"Dame Thomasim Thornburgh<br />
Wiffe of Sir William Thornburgh Knyght<br />
Daughter of Sir Robert Bellingham<br />
Gentle Knyght: the ellventhe of August<br />
On thousand fyue hundreth eightie too."
</p>
</div>

<hr class="minimal" />

<p>The Saxon has been so strongly engrafted
on our language, that, in reading old inscriptions,
especially those, which are likely
to have been spelt, according to the pronunciation,
one is frequently reminded by antient
English words of the modern German
synonyms. A German of the present day
would say for eleven, eilf, pronounced long
like eilve, and for five, funf, pronounced
like fuynf.</p>

<p>Over the chief seat in the old pew of
the Bellinghams is a brass plate, engraved
with the figure of a man in armour, and,
on each side of it, a brass escutcheon, of
which that on the right has a motto thus
spelled, <i>Ains. y L'est</i>. Under the figure is
the following inscription, also cut in brass:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Heer lyeth the bodye of Alan Bellingham esquier
who maryed Catheryan daughter of Anthonye
Ducket esquier by whom he had no children
after whose decease he maryed Dorothie daughter
of Thomas Sanford esquier of whom he had <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>
sonnes &amp; eight daughters, of which five sonnes &amp; 7
daughters with the said Dorothie ar yeat lyving, he
was threescore and one yares of age &amp; dyed y<sup>e</sup> 7 of Maye
A<sup>o</sup> dni 1577.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correctness of inserting the unpronounced
consonants in the words Eight and
Daughters, notwithstanding the varieties of
the other orthography in this inscription,
is a proof of the universality of the Saxon
mode of spelling, with great abundance and
even waste of letters; a mode, which is so
incorporated with our language, that those,
who are for dispensing with it in some
instances, as in the final k in "publick" and
other words, should consider what a general
change they have to effect, or what partial
incongruities they must submit to.</p>

<p>Kendal is built on the lower steeps of a
hill, that towers over the principal street,
and bears on one of its brows a testimony
to the independence of the inhabitants, an
obelisk dedicated to liberty and to the memory
of the Revolution in 1688. At a time,
when the memory of that revolution is
reviled, and the praises of liberty itself endeavoured
to be suppressed by the artifice of
imputing to it the crimes of anarchy, it
was impossible to omit any act of veneration
to the blessings of this event. Being
thus led to ascend the hill, we had a view
of the country, over which it presides; a
scene simple, great and free as the spirit revered
amidst it.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="FROM_KENDAL_TO_BAMPTON" id="FROM_KENDAL_TO_BAMPTON">FROM KENDAL TO BAMPTON AND HAWSWATER.</a></h3>

<p>Of two roads from Kendal to
Bampton one is through Long Sleddale,
the other over Shap-fell, the king of the
Westmoreland mountains; of which routes
the last is the most interesting for simple
sublimity, leading through the heart of the
wildest tracts and opening to such vast
highland scenery as even Derbyshire cannot
shew. We left Kendal by this road, and
from a very old, ruinous bridge had a full
view of the castle, stretching its dark walls
and broken towers round the head of a
green hill, to the southward of the town.
These reliques are, however, too far separated
by the decay of large masses of the
original edifice, and contain little that is individually
picturesque.</p>

<p>The road now lay through shady lanes
and over undulating, but gradually ascending
ground, from whence were pleasant
views of the valley, with now and then a
break in the hills, on the left, opening to a
glimpse of the distant fells towards Windermere,
gray and of more pointed form than
any we had yet seen; for hitherto the
mountains, though of huge outline, were
not so broken, or alpine in their summits
as to strike the fancy with surprise. After
about three miles, a very steep hill shuts
up the vale to the North, and from a gray
rock, near the summit, called Stone-cragg,
the prospect opens over the vale of Kendal
with great dignity and beauty. Its form
from hence seems nearly circular; the
hills spread round it, and sweep with easy
lines into the bottom, green nearly to their
summits, where no fantastic points bend
over it, though rock frequently mingles
with the heath. The castle, or its low
green hill, looked well, nearly in the centre
of the landscape, with Kendal and its mountain,
on the right. Far to the south, were
the groves of Leven's park, almost the only
wood in the scene, and, over the heights
beyond, blue hills bounded the horizon.
On the west, an opening in the near steeps
discovered clusters of huge and broken fells,
while other breaks, on the east, shewed
long ridges stretching towards the south.
Nearer us and to the northward, the hills
rose dark and awful, crowding over and intersecting
each other in long and abrupt
lines, heath and crag their only furniture.</p>

<p>The rough knolls around us and the
dark mountain above gave force to the verdant
beauty and tranquillity of the vale
below, and seemed especially to shelter from
the storms of the north some white farms
and cottages, scattered among enclosures in
the hollows. Soon after reaching the summit
of the mountain itself</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
"A vale appear'd below, a deep retir'd abode,"<br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and we looked down on the left into Long
Sleddale, a little scene of exquisite beauty,
surrounded with images of greatness. This
narrow vale, or glen, shewed a level of the
brightest verdure, with a few cottages scattered
among groves, enclosed by dark fells,
that rose steeply, yet gracefully, and, at
their summits, bent forward in masses of
shattered rock. An hugely pointed mountain,
called Keintmoor-head, shuts up this
sweet scene to the north, rising in a sudden
precipice from the vale, and heightening,
by barren and gloomy steeps, the miniature
beauty, that glowed at its feet. Two
mountains, called Whiteside and Potter's-fell,
screen the perspective; Stone-crag is at
the southern end, fronting Keintmoor-head.
The vale, seen beyond the broken ground
we were upon, formed a landscape of, perhaps,
unexampled variety and grace of colouring;
the tender green of the lowland,
the darker verdure of the woods ascending
the mountains, the brown rough heath
above them, and the impending crags over
all, exhibit their numerous shades, within a
space not more than two miles long, or half
a mile in breadth.</p>

<p>From the right of our road another valley
extended, whose character is that of simple
sublimity, unmixed with any tint of beauty.
The vast, yet narrow perspective sweeps in
ridges of mountains, huge, barren and
brown, point beyond point, the highest of
which, Howgill-fell, gives its name to the
whole district, in which not a wood, a village,
or a farm appeared to cheer the long
vista. A shepherd boy told us the names
of almost all the heights within the horizon,
and we are sorry not to have written
them, for the names of mountains are seldom
compounded of modern, or trivial denominations,
and frequently are somewhat
descriptive of their prototypes. He informed
us also, that we should go over eight
miles of Shap-fell, without seeing a house;
and soon after, at Haw's-foot, we took
leave of the last on the road, entering then
a close valley, surrounded by stupendous
mountains of heath and rock, more towering
and abrupt than those, that had appeared
in moorlands on the other side of
Kendal. A stream, rolling in its rocky
channel, and crossing the road under a
rude bridge, was all that broke the solitary
silence, or gave animation to the view, except
the flocks, that hung upon the precipices,
and which, at that height, were
scarcely distinguishable from the gray round
stones, thickly starting from out the heathy
steeps. The Highlands of Scotland could
scarcely have offered to <span class="smallcaps">Ossian</span> more
images of simple greatness, or more circumstances
for melancholy inspiration. Dark
glens and fells, the mossy stone, the lonely
blast, descending on the valley, the roar of
distant torrents every where occurred; and
to the bard the "song of spirits" would
have swelled with these sounds, and their
fleeting forms have appeared in the clouds,
that frequently floated along the mountain
tops.</p>

<p>The road, now ascending Shap-fell, alternately
climbed the steeps and sunk among
the hollows of this sovereign mountain,
which gives its name to all the surrounding
hills; and, during an ascent of four miles,
we watched every form and attitude of the
features, which composed this vast scenery.
Sometimes we looked from a precipice into
deep vallies, varied only with shades of
heath, with the rude summer hut of the
shepherd, or by streams accumulating into
torrents; and, at others, caught long prospects
over high lands as huge and wild as
the nearer ones, which partially intercepted
them.</p>

<p>The flocks in this high region are so seldom
disturbed by the footsteps of man, that
they have not learned to fear him; they
continued to graze within a few feet of the
carriage, or looked quietly at it, seeming to
consider these mountains as their own.</p>

<p>Near the summit of the road, though not
of the hill, a retrospective glance gave us a
long view over the fells, and of a rich distance
towards Lancaster, rising into blue
hills, which admitted glimpses of sparkling
sea in the bay beyond. This gay perspective,
lighted up by a gleam of sunshine,
and viewed between the brown lines of
the nearer mountains, shewed like the miniature
painting of a landscape, illuminated
beyond a darkened fore-ground.</p>

<p>At the point of every steep, as we ascended,
the air seemed to become thinner,
and, at the northern summit of Shap-fell,
which we reached after nearly two hours'
toil, the wind blew with piercing intenseness,
making it difficult to remain as long
as was due to our admiration of the prospect.
The scene of mountains, which burst
upon us, can be compared only to the
multitudinous waves of the sea. On the
northern, western and eastern scope of the
horizon rose vast ridges of heights, their
broken lines sometimes appearing in seven
or eight successive ranges, though shewing
nothing either fantastic or peaked in their
forms. The autumnal lights, gleaming on
their sides, or shadows sweeping in dark
lines along them, produced a very sublime
effect; while summits more remote were
often misty with the streaming shower, and
others glittered in the partial rays, or were
coloured with the mild azure of distance.
The greater tract of the intervening hills
and Shap-fell itself were, at this time,
darkened with clouds, while Fancy, awed
by the gloom, imaged the genius of Westmoreland
brooding over it and directing
the scowling storm.</p>

<p>A descent of nearly four miles brought
us to Shap, a straggling village, lying on
the side of a bleak hill, feebly sheltered by
clumps of trees. Here, leaving the moorlands,
we were glad to find ourselves again
where "bells have knolled to church," and
in the midst of civilized, though simple life.
After a short rest, at a cleanly little inn, we
proceeded towards Bampton, a village five
miles further in a vale, to which it gives its
name, and one mile from Hawswater, the
lake, that invited us to it. As the road
advanced, the fells of this lake fronted it,
and, closing over the southern end of Bampton
vale, were the most interesting objects
in the view. They were of a character
very different from any yet seen; tall, rocky,
and of more broken and pointed form.
Among them was the high blue peak, called
Kidstow-pike; the broader ridge of Wallow-crag;
a round and still loftier mountain&mdash;Ickolm-moor,
beyond, and, further yet, other
ranges of peaked summits, that overlook
Ullswater.</p>

<p>In a hollow on the left of the road, called
the Vale of Magdalene, are the ruins of
Shap-abbey, built in the reign of John, of
which little now appears except a tower
with pointed windows. The situation is
deeply secluded, and the gloom of the surrounding
mountains may have accorded
well with monastic melancholy.</p>

<p>Proceeding towards Bampton we had a
momentary peep into Hawswater, sunk
deep among black and haggard rocks, and
overtopped by the towering fells before
named, whose summits were involved in
tempest, till the sun, suddenly breaking
out from under clouds, threw a watery
gleam aslant the broken top of Kidstow-pike;
and his rays, struggling with the
shower, produced a fine effect of light, opposed
to the gloom, that wrapt Ickolm-moor
and other huge mountains.</p>

<p>We soon after looked down from the
heights of Bampton upon its open vale,
checquered with corn and meadows, among
which the slender Lowther wound its way
from Hawswater to the vale of Eden,
crossing that of Bampton to the north.
The hills, enriched here and there with
hanging woods and seats, were cultivated
nearly to their summits, except where in
the south the rude heights of Hawswater
almost excluded the lake and shut up the
valley. Immediately below us Bampton grange
lay along the skirt of the hill, and
crossed the Lowther, a gray, rambling and
antient village, to which we descended
among rough common, darkened by plantations
of fir, and between corn enclosures.</p>

<p>The interruption, which enclosed waters
and pathless mountains give to the intercourse
and business of ordinary life, renders
the district, that contains the lakes of Lancashire,
Westmoreland and Cumberland,
more thinly inhabited than is due to the
healthiness of the climate and, perhaps, to
the richness of the vallies. The roads are
always difficult from their steepness, and
in winter are greatly obstructed by snow.
That over Shap-fell to Kendal was, some
years since, entirely impassable, till the inhabitants
of a few scattered towns subscribed
thirty pounds, and a way was cut wide
enough for one horse, but so deep, that the
snow was, on each side, above the rider's
head. It is not in this age of communication
and intelligence, that any person will
be credulously eager to suppose the inhabitants
of one part of the island considerably
or generally distinguished in their characters
from those of another; yet, perhaps, none
can immerge themselves in this country of
the lakes, without being struck by the superior
simplicity and modesty of the people.
Secluded from great towns and from examples
of selfish splendour, their minds
seem to act freely in the sphere of their
own affairs, without interruption from envy
or triumph, as to those of others. They
are obliging, without servility, and plain but
not rude, so that, when, in accosting you,
they omit the customary appellations, you
perceive it to be the familiarity of kindness,
not of disrespect; and they do not bend
with meanness, or hypocrisy, but shew an
independent well meaning, without obtrusiveness
and without the hope of more than
ordinary gain.</p>

<p>Their views of profit from strangers are,
indeed, more limited than we could have
believed, before witnessing it. The servants
at the little inns confess themselves, by their
manner of receiving what you give, to be
almost as much surprised as pleased. A
boy, who had opened four or five gates for
us between Shap and Bampton, blushed
when we called to him to have some halfpence;
and it frequently happened, that
persons, who had looked at the harness, or
rendered some little services of that sort on
the road, passed on, before any thing could
be offered them. The confusion of others,
on being paid, induced us to suppose, at
first, that enough had not been given; but
we were soon informed, that nothing was
expected.</p>

<p>The inns, as here at Bampton, are frequently
humble; and those, who are disposed
to clamour for luxuries, as if there
was a crime in not being able to supply
them, may confound a simple people, and
be themselves greatly discontented, before
they go. But those, who will be satisfied
with comforts, and think the experience of
integrity, carefulness and goodwill is itself a
luxury, will be glad to have stopped at
Bampton and at several other little villages,
where there is some sort of preparation for
travellers.</p>

<p>Nor is this secluded spot without provision
for the mind. A beneficed grammar
school receives the children of the inhabitants,
and sends, we believe, some to an
University. Bishop <span class="smallcaps">Gibson</span> received his
education at it. Bishop <span class="smallcaps">Law</span>, who was
born at Bampton, went daily across one,
or two of the rudest fells on the lake to
another school, at Martindale; an exercise
of no trifling fatigue, or resolution; for
among the things to be gained by seeing
the lakes is a conception of the extreme
wildness of their boundaries. You arrive
with a notion, that you can and dare rove
any where amongst the mountains; and
have only to see three to have the utmost
terror of losing your way.</p>

<p>The danger of wandering in theses regions
without a guide is increased by an
uncertainty, as to the titles of heights; for
the people of each village have a name for
the part of a mountain nearest to themselves,
and they sometimes call the whole by that
name. The circumference of such heights
is also too vast, and the flexures too numerous
to admit of great accuracy. Skiddaw,
Saddleback and Helvellyn, may, however
be certainly distinguished. There are others,
a passage over which would save, perhaps,
eight or ten miles out of twenty, but which
are so little known, except to the shepherds,
that they are very rarely crossed by travellers.
We could not trust to any person's knowledge
of Harter-fell, beyond the head
of Hawswater.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="HAWSWATER" id="HAWSWATER">HAWSWATER.</a></h3>

<p>This is a lake, of which little has
been mentioned, perhaps because it is inferior
in size to the others, but which is
distinguished by the solemn grandeur of its
rocks and mountains, that rise in very bold
and awful characters. The water, about
three miles long, and at the widest only
half a mile over, nearly describes the figure
8, being narrowed in the centre by the
projecting shores; and, at this spot, it is
said to be fifty fathom deep.</p>

<p>Crossing the meadows of Bampton vale
and ascending the opposite heights, we approached
the fells of Hawswater, and, having
proceeded for a mile along the side of
hills, the views over the vale and of the
southern mountains changing with almost
every step, the lake began to open between
a very lofty ridge, covered with forest, and
abrupt fells of heath, or naked rock. Soon
after, we looked upon the first expanse of
the lake. Its eastern shore, rising in a tremendous
ridge of rocks, darkened with
wood to the summit, appears to terminate
in Wallow-crag, a promontory of towering
height, beyond which the lake winds from
view. The finely broken mountains on the
west are covered with heath, and the tops
impend in crags and precipices; but their
ascent from the water is less sudden than
that of the opposite rocks, and they are
skirted by a narrow margin of vivid green,
where cattle were feeding, and tufted shrubs
and little groves overhung the lake and
were reflected on its dark surface. Above,
a very few white cottages among wood
broke in upon the solitude; higher still, the
mountain-flocks were browsing, and above
all, the narrow perspective was closed by
dark and monstrous summits.</p>

<p>As we wound along the bank, the rocks
unfolded and disclosed the second expanse,
with scenery yet more towering and sublime
than the first. This perspective seemed
to be terminated by the huge mountain
called Castle-street; but, as we advanced,
Harter-fell reared his awful front, impending
over the water, and shut in the scene,
where, amidst rocks, and at the entrance of
a glen almost choked by fragments from
the heights, stands the chapel of Martindale,
spoken by the country people Mardale.
Among the fells of this dark prospect are
Lathale, Wilter-crag, Castle-crag and Riggindale,
their bold lines appearing beyond
each other as they fell into the upper part
of the lake, and some of them shewing only
masses of shattered rock. Kidstow-pike is
pre-eminent among the crowding summits
beyond the eastern shore, and the clouds
frequently spread their gloom over its point,
or fall in showers into the cup within; on
the west High-street, which overlooks the
head of Ullswater, is the most dignified of
the mountains.</p>

<p>Leaving the green margin of the lake,
we ascended to the Parsonage, a low, white
building on a knoll, sheltered by the mountain
and a grove of sycamores, with a small
garden in front, falling towards the water.
From the door we had a view of the whole
lake and the surrounding fells, which the
eminence we were upon was just raised
enough to shew to advantage. Nearly opposite
to it the bold promontory of Wallow-crag
pushed its base into the lake, where a
peninsula advanced to meet it, spread with
bright verdure, on which the hamlet of
Martindale lay half concealed among a
grove of oak, beech and sycamore, whose
tints contrasted with the darker one of the
spiry spruce, or more clumped English fir,
and accorded sweetly with the pastoral green
beneath. The ridge of precipices, that
swept from Wallow-crag southward, and
formed a bay for the upper part of the lake,
was despoiled of its forest; but that, which
curved northward, was dark with dwarf-wood
to the water's brim, and, opening
distantly to Bampton vale, let in a gay miniature
landscape, bright in sunshine. Below,
the lake reflected the gloom of the
woods, and was sometimes marked with
long white lines, which, we were told, indicated
bad weather; but, except when a
sudden gust swept the surface, it gave back
every image on the shore, as in a dark
mirror.</p>

<p>The interior of the Parsonage was as
comfortable as the situation was interesting.
A neat parlour opened from the passage,
but it was newly painted, and we were
shewn into the family room, having a large
old-fashioned chimney corner, with benches
to receive a social party, and forming a most
enviable retreat from the storms of the
mountains. Here, in the winter evening,
a family circle, gathering round a blazing
pile of wood on the hearth, might defy the
weather and the world. It was delightful
to picture such a party, happy in their
home, in the sweet affections of kindred and
in honest independence, conversing, working
and reading occasionally, while the blast
was struggling against the casement and the
snow pelting on the roof.</p>

<p>The seat of a long window, overlooking
the lake, offered the delights of other seasons;
hence the luxuriance of summer and
the colouring of autumn successively spread
their enchantments over the opposite woods,
and the meadows that margined the water
below; and a little garden of sweets sent up
its fragrance to that of the honeysuckles,
that twined round the window. Here, too,
lay a store of books, and, to instance that
an inhabitant of this remote nook could not
exclude an interest concerning the distant
world among them was a history of passing
events. Alas! to what scenes, to what display
of human passions and human suffering
did it open! How opposite to the simplicity,
the innocence and the peace of these!</p>

<p>The venerable father of the mansion was
engaged in his duty at his chapel of Martindale,
but we were hospitably received
within, and heard the next day how gladly
he would have rendered any civilities to
strangers.</p>

<p>On leaving this enviable little residence,
we pursued the steeps of the mountain behind
it, and were soon amidst the flocks
and the crags, whence the look-down, upon
the lake and among the fells was solemn
and surprising. About a quarter of a mile
from the Parsonage, a torrent of some dignity
rushed past us, foaming down a rocky
chasm in its way to the lake. Every where,
little streams of crystal clearness wandered
silently among the moss and turf, which
half concealed their progress, or dashed
over the rocks; and, across the largest,
sheep-bridges of flat stone were thrown, to
prevent the flocks from being carried away
in attempting to pass them in winter. The
gray stones, that grew among the heath,
were spotted with mosses of so fine a texture,
that it was difficult to ascertain whether
they were vegetable; their tints were a delicate
pea-green and primrose, with a variety
of colours, which it was not necessary to
be a botanist to admire.</p>

<p>An hour, passed in ascending, brought us
to the brow of Bampton vale, which sloped
gently downward to the north, where it
opened to lines of distant mountains, that
extended far into the east. The woods of
Lowther-park capped two remote hills, and
spread luxuriantly down their sides into the
valley; and nearer, Bampton-grange lay
at the base of a mountain, crowned with fir
plantations, over which, in a distant vale,
we discovered the village of Shap and long
ridges of the highland, passed on the preceding
day.</p>

<p>One of the fells we had just crossed is
called Blanarasa, at the summit of which
two gray stones, each about four feet high,
and placed upright, at the distance of nine
feet from each other, remain of four, which
are remembered to have been formerly
there. The place is still called Four Stones;
but tradition does not relate the design of
the monument; whether to limit adjoining
districts, or to commemorate a battle, or a
hero.</p>

<p>We descended gradually into the vale,
among thickets of rough oaks, on the bank
of a rivulet, which foamed in a deep channel
beneath their foliage, and came to a
glade so sequestered and gloomily overshadowed,
that one almost expected see the
venerable arch of a ruin, peeping between
the branches. It was the very spot, which
the founder of a monastery might have
chosen for his retirement, where the chantings
of a choir might have mingled with
the soothing murmur of the stream, and
monks have glided beneath the solemn trees
in garments scarcely distinguishable from
the shades themselves.</p>

<p>This glade, sloping from the eye, opened
under spreadings oaks to a remote glimpse
of the vale, with blue hills in the distance;
and on the grassy hillocks of the fore-ground
cattle were every where reposing.</p>

<p>We returned, about sun-set, to Bampton,
after a walk of little more than four miles,
which had exhibited a great variety of
scenery, beautiful, romantic and sublime.
At the entrance of the village, the Lowther
and a nameless rivulet, that runs from
Hawswater, join their waters; both streams
were now sunk in their beds; but in winter
they sometimes contend for the conquest
and ravage of the neighbouring plains. The
waters have then risen to the height of five
or six feet in a meadow forty yards from
their summer channels. In an enclosure of
this vale was fought the last battle, or skirmish,
with the Scots in Westmoreland; and
it is within the telling of the sons of great-grandfathers,
that the contest continued, till
the Scots were discovered to fire only pebbles;
the villagers had then the folly to
close with them and the success to drive
them away; but such was the simplicity of
the times, that it was called a victory to
have made one prisoner. Stories of this
sort are not yet entirely forgotten in the
deeply inclosed vales of Westmoreland and
Cumberland, where the greater part of the
present inhabitants can refer to an ancestry
of several centuries, on the same spot.</p>

<p>We thought Bampton, though a very
ill-built village, an enviable spot; having a
clergyman, as we heard, of exemplary
manners, and, as one of us witnessed, of a
most faithful earnestness in addressing his
congregation in the church; being but
slightly removed from one of the lakes,
that accumulates in a small space many of
the varieties and attractions of the others;
and having the adjoining lands distributed,
for the most part, into small farms, so that,
as it is not thought low to be without
wealth, the poor do not acquire the offensive
and disreputable habits, by which they
are too often tempted to revenge, or resist
the ostentation of the rich.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="ULLSWATER" id="ULLSWATER">ULLSWATER.</a></h3>

<p>The ride from Bampton to Ullswater
is very various and delightful. It
winds for about three miles along the
western heights of this green and open vale,
among embowered lanes, that alternately
admit and exclude the pastoral scenes below,
and the fine landscapes on the opposite
hills, formed by the plantations and antient
woods of Lowther-park. These spread over
a long tract, and mingle in sweet variety
with the lively verdure of lawns and meadows,
that slope into the valley, and sometimes
appear in gleams among the dark
thickets. The house, of white stone with
red window-cases, embosomed among the
woods, has nothing in its appearance answerable
to the surrounding grounds. Its
situation and that of the park are exquisitely
happy, just where the vale of Bampton
opens to that of Eden, and the long mountainous
ridge and peak of Cross-fell, aspiring
above them all, stretch before the eye; with
the town of Penrith shelving along the side
of a distant mountain, and its beacon on the
summit; the ruins of its castle appearing
distinctly at the same time, crowning a low
round hill. The horizon to the north and
the east is bounded by lines of mountains,
range above range, not romantic and surprising,
but multitudinous and vast. Of
these, Cross-fell, said to be the highest
mountain in Cumberland, gives its name to
the whole northern ridge, which in its full
extent, from the neighbourhood of Gillsland
to that of Kirkby-Steven, is near fifty
miles. This perspective of the extensive
vale of Eden has grandeur and magnificence
in as high a degree as that of Bampton has
pastoral beauty, closing in the gloomy solitudes
of Hawswater. The vale is finely
wooded, and variegated with mansions,
parks, meadow-land, corn, towns, villages,
and all that make a distant landscape rich.
Among the peculiarities of it, are little
mountains of alpine shape, that start up like
pyramids in the middle of the vale, some
covered with wood, others barren and rocky.
The scene perhaps only wants a river like
the Rhine, or the Thames, to make it the
very finest in England for union of grandeur,
beauty and extent.</p>

<p>Opposite Lowther-hall, we gave a farewell
look to the pleasant vale of Bampton
and its southern fells, as the road, winding
more to the west, led us over the high lands,
that separate it from the vale of Emont.
Then, ascending through shady lanes and
among fields where the oat harvest was
gathering, we had enchanting retrospects of
the vale of Eden, spreading to the east, with
all its chain of mountains chequered by the
autumnal shadows.</p>

<p>Soon after, the road brought us to the
brows of Emont, a narrow well-wooded
vale, the river, from which it takes its
name, meandering through it from Ullswater
among pastures and pleasure-grounds,
to meet the Lowther near Brougham Castle.
Penrith and its castle and beacon look up
the vale from the north, and the astonishing
fells of Ullswater close upon it in the south;
while Delemain, the house, and beautiful
grounds of Mr. Hassel, Hutton St. John, a
venerable old mansion, and the single tower
called Dacre-castle adorn the valley. But
who can pause to admire the elegancies of
art, when surrounded by the wonders of
nature? The approach to this sublime lake
along the heights of Emont is exquisitely
interesting; for the road, being shrouded by
woods, allows the eye only partial glimpses
of the gigantic shapes, that are assembled
in the distance, and, awakening high expectation,
leaves the imagination, thus elevated,
to paint the "forms of things unseen."
Thus it was, when we caught a
first view of the dark broken tops of the
fells, that rise round Ullswater, of size and
shape most huge, bold, and awful; overspread
with a blue mysterious tint, that
seemed almost supernatural, though according
in gloom and sublimity with the severe
features it involved.</p>

<p>Further on, the mountains began to unfold
themselves; their outlines, broken,
abrupt and intersecting each other in innumerable
directions, seemed, now and then,
to fall back like a multitude at some supreme
command, and permitted an oblique
glimpse into the deep vales. A close lane
then descended towards Pooly-bridge, where,
at length, the lake itself appeared beyond
the spreading branches, and, soon after, the
first reach expanded before us, with all its
mountains tumbled round it; rocky, ruinous
and vast, impending, yet rising in wild
confusion and multiplied points behind each
other.</p>

<p>This view of the first reach from the foot
of Dunmallet, a pointed woody hill, near
Pooly-bridge, is one of the finest on the
Jake, which here spreads in a noble sheet,
near three miles long, and almost two
miles broad, to the base of Thwaithill-nab,
winding round which it disappears, and the
whole is then believed to be seen. The
character of this view is nearly that of simple
grandeur; the mountains, that impend
over the shore in front, are peculiarly awful
in their forms and attitudes; on the left,
the fells soften; woodlands, and their pastures,
colour their lower declivities, and the
water is margined with the tenderest verdure,
opposed to the dark woods and crags
above. On the right, a green conical hill
slopes to the shore, where cattle were reposing
on the grass, or sipping the clear
wave; further, rise the bolder rocks of
Thwaithill-nab, where the lake disappears,
and, beyond, the dark precipices and summits
of fells, that crown the second reach.</p>

<p>Winding the foot of Dunmallet, the almost
pyramidal hill, that shuts up this end
of Ullswater, and separates it from the vale
of Emont, we crossed Barton bridge, where
this little river, clear as crystal, issues from
the lake, and through a close pass hurries
over a rocky channel to the vale. Its
woody steeps, the tufted island, that interrupts
its stream, and the valley beyond,
form altogether a picture in fine contrast
with the majesty of Ullswater, expanding
on the other side of the bridge.</p>

<p>We followed the skirts of a smooth green
hill, the lake, on the other hand, flowing
softly against the road and shewing every
pebble on the beach beneath, and proceeded
towards the second bend; but soon mounted
from the shore among the broken knolls
of Dacre-common, whence we had various
views of the first reach, its scenery appearing
in darkened majesty as the autumnal
shadows swept over it. Sometimes, however,
the rays, falling in gleams upon the
water, gave it the finest silvery tone imaginable,
sober though splendid. Dunmallet
at the foot of the lake was a formal unpleasing
object, not large enough to be
grand, or wild enough to be romantic.</p>

<p>The ground of the common is finely
broken, and is scattered sparingly with
white cottages, each picturesquely shadowed
by its dark grove; above, rise plantations
and gray crags which lead the eye forward
to the alpine forms, that crown the second
reach, changing their attitudes every instant
as they are approached.</p>

<p>Ullswater in all its windings, which give
it the form of the letter S, is nearly nine
miles long; the width is various, sometimes
nearly two miles and seldom less than
one; but Skelling-nab, a vast rock in the
second reach, projects so as to reduce it
to less than a quarter of a mile. These are
chiefly the reputed measurements, but the
eye loses its power of judging even of the
breadth, confounded by the boldness of the
shores and the grandeur of the fells, that
rise beyond; the proportions however are
grand, for the water retains its dignity,
notwithstanding the vastness of its accompaniments;
a circumstance, which Derwentwater
can scarcely boast.</p>

<p>The second bend, assuming the form of
a river, is very long, but generally broad,
and brought strongly to remembrance some
of the passes of the Rhine beyond Coblentz:
though, here, the rocks, that rise over the
water, are little wooded; and, there, their
skirts are never margined by pasture,
or open to such fairy summer scenes of
vivid green mingling with shades of wood
and gleams of corn, as sometimes appear
within the recesses of these wintry mountains.
These cliffs, however, do not shew
the variety of hue, or marbled veins, that
frequently surprise and delight on the Rhine,
being generally dark and gray, and the varieties
in their complexion, when there are
any, purely a&euml;rial; but they are vast and
broken; rise immediately from the stream,
and often shoot their masses over it; while
the expanse of water below accords with
the dignity of that river in many of its
reaches. Once too, there were other points
of resemblance, in the ruins of monasteries
and convents, which, though reason rejoices
that they no longer exist, the eye may be
allowed to regret. Of these, all which now
remains on record is, that a society of Benedictine
monks was founded on the summit
of Dunmallet, and a nunnery of the
same order on a point behind Sowlby-fell;
traces of these ruins, it is said, may still be
seen.</p>

<p>Thus grandeur and immensity are the
characteristics of the left shore of the second
reach; the right exhibits romantic
wildness in the rough ground of Dacre-common
and the craggy heights above, and,
further on, the sweetest forms of reposing
beauty, in the grassy hillocks and undulating
copses of Gowbarrow-park, fringing the
water, sometimes over little rocky eminences,
that project into the stream, and, at
others, in shelving bays, where the lake,
transparent as crystal, breaks upon the pebbly
bank, and laves the road, that winds
there. Above these pastoral and sylvan
landscapes, rise broken precipices, less tremendous
than those of the opposite shore,
with pastures pursuing the crags to a considerable
height, speckled with cattle, which
are exquisitely picturesque, as they graze
upon the knolls and among the old trees,
that adorn this finely declining park.</p>

<p>Leaving the hamlet of Watermillock at
some distance on the left, and passing
the seat of Mr. Robinson, sequestered in the
gloom of beech and sycamores, there are
fine views over the second reach, as the
road descends the common towards Gowbarrow.
Among the boldest fells, that
breast the lake on the left shore, are Holling-fell
and Swarth-fell, now no longer
boasting any part of the forest of Martindale,
but shewing huge walls of naked rock,
and scars, which many torrents have inflicted.
One channel only in this dry season
retained its shining stream; the chasm
was dreadful, parting the mountain from
the summit to the base; and its waters in
winter, leaping in foam from precipice to
precipice, must be infinitely sublime; not,
however, even then from their mass, but
from the length and precipitancy of their
descent.</p>

<p>The perspective as the road descends into
Gowbarrow-park is perhaps the very finest
on the lake. The scenery of the first reach
is almost tame when compared with this,
and it is difficult to say where it can be
equalled for Alpine sublimity, and so
effecting wonder and awful elevation. The
lake, after expanding at a distance to great
breadth, once more loses itself beyond the
enormous pile of rock called Place-fell, opposite
to which the shore, seeming to close
upon all further progress, is bounded by
two promontories covered with woods, that
shoot their luxuriant foliage to the water's
edge. The shattered mass of gray rock,
called Yew-crag, rises immediately over
these, and, beyond, a glen opens to a chaos
of mountains more solemn in their aspect,
and singular in their shapes, than any
which have appeared, point crowding over
point in lofty succession. Among these is
Stone-cross-pike and huge Helvellyn, scowling
over all; but, though this retains its
pre-eminence, its dignity is lost in the mass
of alps around and below it. A fearful
gloom involved them; the shadows of a
stormy sky upon mountains of dark rock
and heath. All this is seen over the woody
fore-ground of the park, which, soon
shrouding us in its bowery lanes, allowed
the eye and the fancy to repose, while venturing
towards new forms and assemblages
of sublimity.</p>

<p>Meantime, the green shade, under which
we passed, where the sultry low of cattle,
and the sound of streams hurrying from
the heights through the copses of Gowbarrow
to the lake below, were all that broke
the stillness; these, with gleamings of the
water, close on the left, between the foliage,
and which was ever changing its hue, sometimes
assuming the soft purple of a pigeon's
neck, at others the silvery tint of sunshine&mdash;these
circumstances of imagery were in
soothing and beautiful variety with the gigantic
visions we had lost.</p>

<p>The road still pursuing this border of the
lake, the copses opened to partial views of
the bold rocks, that form the opposite
shore, and many a wild recess and solemn
glen appeared and vanished among them,
some shewing only broken fells, the sides
of others shaggy with forests, and nearly all
lined, at their bases, with narrow pastures
of the most exquisite verdure. Thus descending
upon a succession of sweeping bays,
where the shades parted, and admitted the
lake, that flowed even with us, and again
retreating from it over gentle eminences,
where it glittered only between the leaves;
crossing the rude bridges of several becks,
rapid, clear and foaming among dark stones,
and receiving a green tint from the closely
shadowing trees, but neither precipitous
enough in their descent, nor ample enough
in their course, to increase the dignity of
the scene, we came, after passing nearly
three miles through the park, to Lyulph's
Tower. This mansion, a square, gray edifice,
with turreted corners, battlements and
windows in the Gothic style, has been built
by the present Duke of Norfolk in one of
the finest situations of a park, abounding
with views of the grand and the sublime.
It stands on a green eminence, a little removed
from the water, backed with wood
and with pastures rising abruptly beyond,
to the cliffs and crags that crown them.
In front, the ground falls finely to the
lake's edge, broken, yet gentle, and scattered
over with old trees, and darkened with
copses, which mingle in fine variety of tints
with the light verdure of the turf beneath.
Herds of deer, wandering over the knolls,
and cattle, reposing in the shade, completed
this sweet landscape.</p>

<p>The lake is hence seen to make one of
its boldest expanses, as it sweeps round
Place-fell, and flows into the third and last
bend of this wonderful vale. Lyulph's
Tower looks up this reach to the south, and
to the east traces all the fells and curving
banks of Gowbarrow, that bind the second;
while, to the west, a dark glen
opens to a glimpse of the solemn alps
round Helvellyn; and all these objects are
seen over the mild beauty of the park.</p>

<p>Passing fine sweeps of the shore and over
bold headlands, we came opposite to the
vast promontory, called Place-fell, that
pushes its craggy foot into the lake, like a
lion's claw, round which the waters make a
sudden turn, and enter Patterdale, their
third and final expanse. In this reach,
they lose the form of a river, and resume
that of a lake, being closed, at three miles
distance, by the ruinous rocks, that guard
the gorge of Patterdale, backed by a multitude
of fells. The water, in this scope,
is of oval form, bounded on one side by
the precipices of Place-fell, Martindale-fell,
and several others, equally rude and awful
that rise from its edge, and shew no lines
of verdure, or masses of; wood, but retire
in rocky bays, or projects in vast promontories
athwart it. The opposite shore is
less severe and more romantic; the rocks
are lower and richly wooded, and, often
receding from the water, leave room for a
tract of pasture, meadow land and corn, to
margin their ruggedness. At the upper
end, the village of Patterdale and one of
two white farms, peep out from among
trees beneath the scowling mountains, that
close the scene; pitched in a rocky nook,
with corn and meadow land, sloping gently
in front to the lake, and, here and there, a
scattered grove. But this scene is viewed
to more advantage from one of the two
woody eminences, that overhang the lake,
just at the point where it forms its last angle,
and, like an opened compass, spreads
its two arms before the eye. These heights
are extremely beautiful, viewed from the
opposite shore, and had long charmed us
at a distance. Approaching them, we crossed
another torrent, Glencoyn-beck, or Airey-force,
which here divides not only the
estates of the Duke of Norfolk and Mr.
Hodgkinson, but the counties of Westmoreland
and Cumberland; and all the fells beyond,
that enclose the last bend of Ullswater,
are in Patterdale. Here, on the
right, at the feet of awful rocks, was spread
a gay autumnal scene, in which the peasants
were singing merrily as they gathered the
oats into sheafs; woods, turfy hillocks, and,
above all, tremendous crags, abruptly closing
round the yellow harvest. The figures,
together with the whole landscape, resembled
one of those beautifully fantastic scenes,
which fable calls up before the wand of the
magician.</p>

<p>Entering Glencoyn woods and sweeping
the boldest bay of the lake, while the water
dashed with a strong surge upon the shore,
we at length mounted a road frightful from
its steepness and its crags, and gained one
of the wooded summits so long admired.
From hence the view of Ullswater is the
most extensive and various, that its shores
exhibit, comprehending its two principal
reaches, and though not the most picturesque,
it is certainly the most grand. To
the east, extends the middle sweep in long
and equal perspective, walled with barren
fells on the right, and margined on the left
with the pastoral recesses and bowery projections
of Gowbarrow park. The rude
mountains above almost seemed to have
fallen back from the shore to admit this
landscape within their hollow bosom, and
then, bending abruptly, appear, like Milton's
Adam viewing the sleeping Eve, to
hang over it enamoured.</p>

<p>Lyulph's Tower is the only object of art,
except the hamlet of Watermillock, seen in
the distant perspective, that appears in the
second bend of Ullswater; and this loses
much of its effect from the square uniformity
of the structure, and the glaring green
of its painted window-cases. This is the
longest reach of the lake.</p>

<p>Place-fell, which divides the two last
bends, and was immediately opposite to the
point we were on, is of the boldest form.
It projects into the water, an enormous
mass of gray crag, scarred with dark hues;
thence retiring a little it again bends forward
in huge cliffs, and finally starts up
into a vast perpendicular face of rock. As
a single object, it is wonderfully grand; and,
connected with the scene, its effect is sublime.
The lower rocks are called Silver-rays,
and not inaptly; for, when the sun
shines upon them, their variegated sides
somewhat resemble in brightness the rays
streaming beneath a cloud.</p>

<p>The last reach of Ullswater, which is on
the right of this point, expands into an oval,
and its majestic surface is spotted with little
rocky islets, that would adorn a less sacred
scene; here they are prettinesses, that can
scarcely be tolerated by the grandeur of its
character. The tremendous mountains,
which scowl over the gorge of Patterdale;
the cliffs, massy, broken and overlooked by
a multitude of dark summits, with the grey
walls of Swarth and Martindale fells, that
upheave themselves on the eastern shore,
form altogether one of the most grand and
awful pictures on the lake; yet, admirable
and impressive as it is, as to solemnity and
astonishment, its effect with us was not
equal to that of the more alpine sketch,
caught in distant perspective from the descent
into Gowbarrow-park.</p>

<p>In these views of Ullswater, sublimity
and greatness are the predominating characters,
though beauty often glows upon
the western bank. The mountains are all
bold, gloomy and severe. When we saw
them, the sky accorded well with the scene,
being frequently darkened by autumnal
clouds; and the equinoctial gale swept the
surface of the lake, marking its blackness
with long white lines, and beating its waves
over the rocks to the foliage of the thickets
above. The trees, that shade these eminences,
give greater force to the scenes,
which they either partially exclude, or
wholly admit, and become themselves fine
objects, enriched as they are with the darkest
moss.</p>

<p>From hence the ride to the village of
Patterdale, at the lake's head, is, for the first
part, over precipices covered with wood,
whence you look down, on the left, upon
the water, or upon pastures stretching to it;
on the right, the rocks rise abruptly, and
often impend their masses over the road;
or open to narrow dells, green, rocky and
overlooked by endless mountains.</p>

<p>About half way to the village of Patterdale,
a peninsula spreads from this shore
into the lake, where a white house, peeping
from a grove and surrounded with green
enclosures, is beautifully placed. This is
an inn, and, perhaps the principal one, as
to accommodation; but, though its situation
on a spot which on each side commands
the lake, is very fine, it is not comparable,
in point of wildness and sublimity,
to that of the cottage, called the King's
Arms, at Patterdale. In the way thither,
are enchanting catches of the lake, between
the trees on the left, and peeps into the
glens, that wind among the alps towards
Helvellyn, on the right. These multiply
near the head of Ullswater, where they
start off as from one point, like radii, and
conclude in trackless solitudes.</p>

<p>It is difficult to spread varied pictures of
such scenes before the imagination. A repetition
of the same images of rock, wood
and water, and the same epithets of grand,
vast and sublime, which necessarily occur,
must appear tautologous, on paper, though
their archetypes in nature, ever varying in
outline, or arrangement, exhibit new visions
to the eye, and produce new shades of
effect on the mind. It is difficult, also,
where these delightful differences have been
experienced, to forbear dwelling on the remembrance,
and attempting to sketch the
peculiarities, which occasioned them. The
scenery at the head of Ullswater is especially
productive of such difficulties, where a wish
to present the picture, and a consciousness
of the impossibility of doing so, except by
the pencil, meet and oppose each other.</p>

<p>Patterdale itself is a name somewhat familiar
to recollection, from the circumstance
of the chief estate in it having given to its
possessors, for several centuries, the title of
Kings of Patterdale. The last person so distinguished
was richer than his ancestors,
having increased his income, by the most
ludicrous parsimony, to a thousand pounds
a year. His son and successor is an industrious
country gentleman, who has improved
the sort of farming mansion, annexed
to the estate, and, not affecting to
depart much from the simple manners of
the other inhabitants, is respectable enough
to be generally called by his own name of
Mounsey, instead of the title, which was
probably seldom given to his ancestors, but
in some sort of mockery.</p>

<p>The village is very humble, as to the
conditions and views of the inhabitants;
and very respectable, as to their integrity
and simplicity, and to the contentment,
which is proved by the infrequency of emigrations
to other districts. It straggles at
the feet of fells, somewhat removed from
the lake and near the entrance of the wild
vale of Glenridding. Its white church is
seen nearly from the commencement of the
last reach, rising among trees, and in the
church-yard are the ruins of an antient yew,
of remarkable size and venerable beauty;
its trunk, hollowed and silvered by age, resembles
twisted roots; yet the branches,
that remain above, are not of melancholy
black, but flourish in rich verdure and flaky
foliage.</p>

<p>The inn is beyond the village, securely
sheltered under high crags, while enormous
fells, close on the right, open to the gorge
of Patterdale; and Coldrill-beck, issuing
from it, descends among the corn and meadows,
to join the lake at little distance.
We had a happy evening at this cleanly
cottage, where there was no want, without
its recompense, from the civil offices of the
people. Among the rocks, that rose over
it, is a station, which has been more frequently
selected than any other on the lake
by the painter and the lover of the <i>beau
id&eacute;e</i>, as the French and Sir <span class="smallcaps">Joshua Reynolds</span>
expressively term what Mr. <span class="smallcaps">Burke</span>
explains in his definition of the word <i>fine</i>.
Below the point, on which we stood, a
tract of corn and meadow land fell gently
to the lake, which expanded in great majesty
beyond, bounded on the right by the
precipices of many fells, and, on the left,
by rocks finely wooded, and of more broken
and spiry outline. The undulating pastures
and copses of Gowbarrow closed the perspective.
Round the whole of these shores,
but particularly on the left, rose clusters of
dark and pointed summits, assuming great
variety of shape, amongst which Helvellyn
was still pre-eminent. Immediately around
us, all was vast and gloomy; the fells
mount swiftly and to enormous heights,
leaving at their bases only crags and hillocks,
tufted with thickets of dwarf-oak and
holly, where the beautiful cattle, that adorned
them, and a few sheep, were picking a
scanty supper among the heath.</p>

<p>From this spot glens open on either
hand, that lead the eye only to a chaos of
mountains. The profile of one near the
fore-ground on the right is remarkably
grand, shelving from the summit in one
vast sweep of rock, with only some interruption
of craggy points near its base, into
the water. On one side, it unites with
the fells in the gorge of Patterdale, and, on
the other, winds into a bold bay for the
lake. Among the highlands, seen over the
left shore, is Common-fell, a large heathy
mountain, which appeared to face us.
Somewhat nearer, is a lower one, called
Glenridding, and above it the Nab. Grassdale
has Glenridding and the Nab on one
side towards the water, and Birks-fell and
St. Sunday's-crag over that, on the other.
The points, that rise above the Nab, are
Stridon-edge, then Cove's head, and, over
all, the precipices of dark Helvellyn, now
appearing only at intervals among the
clouds.</p>

<p>Not only every fell of this wild region
has a name, but almost every crag of every
fell, so that shepherds sitting at the fire-side
can direct each other to the exact spot
among the mountains, where a stray sheep
has been seen.</p>

<p>Among the rocks on the right shore, is
Martindale-fell, once shaded with a forest,
from which it received its name, and which
spreading to a vast extent over the hills and
vallies beyond, even as far as Hawswater,
darkened the front of Swarth-fell and several
others, that impend over the first and
second reach of Ullswater. Of the mountains,
which tower above the glen of Patterdale,
the highest are Harter's fell, Kidstow-pike,
and the ridge, called the High-street;
a name, which reminded us of the
German denomination, <i>Berg-strasse</i>.</p>

<p>The effect of a stormy evening upon
the scenery was solemn. Clouds smoked
along the fells, veiling them for a moment,
and passing on to other summits; or sometimes
they involved the lower steeps, leaving
the tops unobscured and resembling
islands in a distant ocean. The lake was
dark and tempestuous, dashing the rocks
with a strong foam. It was a scene worthy
of the sublimity of Ossian, and brought
to recollection some touches of his gloomy
pencil. "When the storms of the mountains
come, when the north lifts the waves
on high, I sit by the sounding shore, &amp;c."</p>

<p>A large hawk, sailing proudly in the air,
and wheeling among the stormy clouds, superior
to the shock of the gust, was the
only animated object in the upward prospect.
We were told, that the eagles had
forsaken their aeries in this neighbourhood
and in Borrowdale, and are fled to the isle
of Man; but one had been seen in Patterdale,
the day before, which, not being at
its full growth, could not have arrived from
a great distance.</p>

<p>We returned to our low-roofed habitation,
where, as the wind swept in hollow
gusts along the mountains and strove
against our casements, the crackling blaze
of a wood fire lighted up the cheerfulness,
which, so long since as Juvenal's time, has
been allowed to arise from the contrast of
ease against difficulty. <i>Suave mari magno,
turbantibus aquora ventis</i>; and, however we
might exclaim,</p>

<h3><a name="BROUGHAM_CASTLE" id="BROUGHAM_CASTLE">BROUGHAM CASTLE.</a></h3>

<p>The next morning, we proceeded
from Ullswater along the vale of Emont,
so sweetly adorned by the woods and lawns
of Dalemain, the seat of Mr. Hassel, whose
mansion is seen in the bottom. One of the
most magnificent prospects in the country
is when this vale opens to that of Eden.
The mountainous range of Cross-fell fronted
us, and its appearance, this day, was very
striking, for the effect of autumnal light
and shade. The upper range, bright in
sunshine, appeared to rise, like light clouds
above the lower, which was involved in
dark shadow, so that it was a considerable
time before the eye could detect the illusion.
The effect of this was inexpressibly
interesting.</p>

<p>Within view of Emont bridge, which
divides the counties of Cumberland and
Westmoreland, is that memorial of antient
times, so often described under the name of
Arthur's Round Table; a green circular
spot of forty paces diameter, enclosed by a
dry ditch, and, beyond this, by a bank;
each in sufficient preservation to shew exactly
what has been its form. In the midst
of the larger circle is another of only seven
paces diameter. We have no means of
adding to, or even of corroborating any of
the well known conjectures, concerning the
use of this rude and certainly very antient
monument. Those not qualified to propose
decisions in this respect may, however,
suffer themselves to believe, that the bank
without the ditch and the enclosure within
it were places for different classes of persons,
interested as parties, or spectators, in some
transactions, passing within the inner circle;
and that these, whether religious, civil, or
military ceremonies, were rendered distinct
and conspicuous, for the purpose of impressing
them upon the memory of the spectators,
at a time when memory and tradition
were the only preservatives of history.</p>

<p>Passing a bridge, under which the Lowther,
from winding and romantic banks,
enters the vale of Eden, we ascended between
the groves of Bird's Nest, or, as it
is now called, Brougham Hall; a white
mansion, with battlements and gothic windows,
having formerly a bird painted on
the front. It is perched among woods, on
the brow of a steep, but not lofty hill, and
commands enchanting prospects over the
vale. The winding Emont; the ruins of
Brougham Castle on a green knoll of Whinfield
park, surrounded with old groves; far
beyond this, the highlands of Cross-fell; to
the north, Carleton-hall, the handsome modern
mansion of Mr. Wallace, amidst lawns
of incomparable verdure and luxuriant
woods falling from the heights; further
still, the mountain, town and beacon of
Penrith; these are the principal features of
the rich landscape, spread before the eye
from the summit of the hill, at Bird's
Nest.</p>

<p>As we descended to Brougham Castle,
about a mile further, its ruined masses of
pale red stone, tufted with shrubs and
plants, appeared between groves of fir,
beach, oak and ash, amidst the broken
ground of Whinfield park, a quarter of a
mile through which brought us to the ruin
itself. It was guarded by a sturdy mastiff,
worthy the office of porter to such a place,
and a good effigy of the Sir Porter of a former
age. Brougham Castle, venerable for
its well-certified antiquity and for the hoary
masses it now exhibits, is rendered more
interesting by having been occasionally the
residence of the humane and generous Sir
Philip Sydney; who had only to look from
the windows of this once noble edifice to
see his own "Arcadia" spreading on every
side. The landscape probably awakened
his imagination, for it was during a visit
here, that the greatest part of that work was
written.</p>

<p>This edifice, once amongst the strongest
and most important of the border fortresses,
is supposed to have been founded by the
Romans; but the first historical record concerning
it is dated in the time of William
the Conqueror, who granted it to his nephew,
Hugh de Albinois. His successors
held it, till 1170, when Hugh de Morville,
one of the murderers of Thomas a Becket,
forfeited it by his crime. Brougham was
afterwards granted by King John to a
grandson of Hugh, Robert de Vipont,
whose grandson again forfeited the estate,
which was, however, restored to his daughters,
one of whom marrying a De Clifford,
it remained in this family, till a daughter of
the celebrated Countess of Pembroke gave
it by marriage to that of the Tuftons, Earls
of Thanet, in which it now remains.</p>

<p>This castle has been thrice nearly demolished;
first by neglect, during the minority
of Roger de Vipont, after which it
was sufficiently restored to receive James
the First, on his return from Scotland, in
1617; secondly, in the civil wars of Charles
the First's time; and thirdly, in 1728,
when great part of the edifice was deliberately
taken down, and the materials sold for
one hundred pounds. Some of the walls
still remaining are twelve feet thick, and
the places are visible, in which the massy
gates were held to them by hinges and
bolts of uncommon size. A fuller proof of
the many sacrifices of comfort and convenience,
by which the highest classes in former
ages were glad to purchase security, is
very seldom afforded, than by the three detached
parts still left of this edifice; but
they shew nothing of the magnificence and
gracefulness, which so often charm the eye
in gothic ruins. Instead of these, they exhibit
symptoms of the cruelties, by which
their first lords revenged upon others the
wretchedness of the continual suspicion felt
by themselves. Dungeons, secret passages
and heavy iron rings remain to hint of unhappy
wretches, who were, perhaps, rescued
only by death from these horrible engines
of a tyrant's will. The bones probably of
such victims are laid beneath the damp
earth of these vaults.</p>

<p>A young woman from a neighbouring
farm-house conducted us over broken banks,
washed by the Emont, to what had been
the grand entrance of the castle; a venerable
gothic gateway, dark and of great
depth, passing under a square tower, finely
shadowed by old elms. Above, are a cross-loop
and two tier of small pointed windows; no
battlements appear at the top;
but four rows of corbells, which probably
once supported them, now prop some
tufts of antient thorn, that have roots in
their fractures.</p>

<p>As we passed under this long gateway,
we looked into what is still called the Keep,
a small vaulted room, receiving light only
from loops in the outward wall; Near a
large fire-place, yet entire, is a trap door
leading to the dungeon below; and, in an
opposite corner, a door-case to narrow stairs,
that wind up the turret where, too, as well
as in the vault, prisoners were probably
secured. One almost saw the surly keeper
descending through this door-case, and
heard him rattle the keys of the chambers
above, listening with indifference to the
clank of chains and to the echo of that
groan below, which seemed to rend the
heart it burst from.</p>

<p>This gloomy gateway, which had once
sounded with the trumpets and horses of
James the First, when he visited the Earl of
Cumberland, this gateway, now serving
only to shelter cattle from the storm, opens,
at length, to a grassy knoll, with bold
masses of the ruin scattered round it and a
few old ash trees, waving in the area.
Through a fractured arch in the rampart
some features in the scenery without appear
to advantage; the Emont falling over a weir
at some distance, with fulling-mills on the
bank above; beyond, the pastured slopes
and woodlands of Carleton park, and Cross-fell
sweeping the back-ground.</p>

<p>Of the three ruinous parts, that now remain
of the edifice, one large square mass,
near the tower and gateway, appears to
have contained the principal apartments;
the walls are of great height, and, though
roofless, nearly entire. We entered what
seemed to have been the great hall, now
choaked with rubbish and weeds. It was
interesting to look upwards through the
void, and trace by the many window-cases,
that appeared at different heights in the
walls, somewhat of the plan of apartments,
whose floors and ceilings had long since
vanished; majestic reliques, which shewed,
that here, as well as at Hardwick, the chief
rooms had been in the second story. Door-cases,
that had opened to rooms without
this building, with remains of passages
within the walls, were frequently seen, and,
here and there, in a corner at a vast height,
fragments of a winding stair-case, appearing
beyond the arch of a slender door-way.</p>

<p>We were tempted to enter a ruinous passage
below, formed in the great thickness of
the walls; but it was soon lost in darkness,
and we were told that no person had ventured
to explore the end of this, or of many
similar passages among the ruins, now the
dens of serpents and other venomous reptiles.
It was probably a secret way to the
great dungeon, which may still be seen, underneath
the hall; for the roof remains,
though what was called the Sweating Pillar,
from the dew, that was owing to its damp
situation and its seclusion from outward air,
no longer supports it. Large iron rings,
fastened to the carved heads of animals, are
still shewn in the walls of this dungeon.
Not a single loop-hole was left by the contriver
of this hideous vault for the refreshment
of prisoners; yet were they insulted
by some display of gothic elegance, for the
pillar already mentioned, supporting the
centre of the roof, spread from thence into
eight branches, which descended the walls,
and terminated at the floor in the heads,
holding the iron rings.</p>

<p>The second mass of the ruin, which,
though at a considerable distance from the
main building, was formerly connected with
it, shews the walls of many small chambers,
with reliques of the passages and stairs, that
led to them. But, perhaps, the only picturesque
feature of the castle is the third detachment;
a small tower finely shattered,
having near its top a flourishing ash, growing
from the solid walls, and overlooking
what was once the moat. We mounted a
perilous stair-case, of which many steps
were gone, and others trembled to the pressure;
then gained a turret, of which two
sides were also fallen, and, at length, ascended
to the whole magnificence and sublimity
of the prospect.</p>

<p>To the east, spread nearly all the rich
vale of Eden, terminated by the Stainmore
hills and other highlands of Yorkshire; to
the north-east, the mountains of Cross-fell
bounded the long landscape. The nearer
grounds were Whinfield-park, broken, towards
the Emont, into shrubby steeps,
where the deep red of the soil mingled with
the verdure of foliage; part of Sir Michael
le Fleming's woods rounding a hill on the
opposite bank, and, beyond, a wide extent
of low land. To the south, swelled the
upland boundaries of Bampton-vale, with
Lowther-woods, shading the pastures and
distantly crowned by the fells of Hawswater;
more to the west, Bird's Nest, "bosomed
high in tufted trees;" at its foot,
Lowther-bridge, and, a little further, the
neat hamlet and bridge of Emont. In the
low lands, still nearer, the Lowther and
Emont united, the latter flowing in shining
circles among the woods and deep-green
meadows of Carleton-park. Beyond, at a
vast distance to the west and north, rose all
the alps of all the lakes! an horizon scarcely
to be equalled in England. Among these
broken mountains, the shaggy ridge of Saddleback
was proudly pre-eminent; but one
forked top of its rival Skiddaw peeped over
its declining side. Helvellyn, huge and misshapen,
towered above the fells of Ullswater.
The sun's rays, streaming from beneath
a line of dark clouds, that overhung
the west, gave a tint of silvery light to all
these alps, and reminded us of the first exquisite
appearance of the mountains, at
Goodesberg, which, however, in grandeur
and elegance of outline, united with picturesque
richness, we have never seen equalled.</p>

<p>Of the walls around us every ledge,
marking their many stories, was embossed
with luxuriant vegetation. Tufts of the
hawthorn seemed to grow from the solid
stone, and slender saplings of ash waved
over the deserted door-cases, where, at the
transforming hour of twilight, the superstitious
eye might mistake them for spectres
of some early possessor of the castle, restless
from guilt, or of some sufferer persevering
from vengeance.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_TOWN_AND_BEACON_OF_PENRITH" id="THE_TOWN_AND_BEACON_OF_PENRITH">THE TOWN AND BEACON OF PENRITH.</a></h3>

<p>Having pursued the road one mile
further, for the purpose of visiting the tender
memorial of pious affection, so often
described under the name of Countess' Pillar,
we returned to Emont-bridge, and from
thence reached Penrith, pronounced Peyrith,
the most southern town of Cumberland.
So far off as the head of Ullswater,
fourteen miles, this is talked of as an important
place, and looked to as the store-house
of whatever is wanted more than
the fields and lakes supply. Those, who
have lived chiefly in large towns, have to
learn from the wants and dependencies of
a people thinly scattered, like the inhabitants
of all mountainous regions, the great
value of any places of mutual resort, however
little distinguished in the general view
of a country. Penrith is so often mentioned
in the neighbourhood, that the first appearance
of it somewhat disappointed us, because
we had not considered how many serious
reasons those, who talked of it, might have
for their estimation, which should yet not at
all relate to the qualities, that render places
interesting to a traveller.</p>

<p>The town, consisting chiefly of old
houses, straggles along two sides of the high
north road, and is built upon the side of a
mountain, that towers to great height above
it, in steep and heathy knolls, unshaded by
a single tree. Eminent, on the summit of
this mountain, stands the old, solitary beacon,
visible from almost every part of Penrith,
which, notwithstanding its many symptoms
of antiquity, is not deficient of neatness.
The houses are chiefly white, with
door and window cases of the red stone
found in the neighbourhood. Some of the
smaller have over their doors dates of the
latter end of the sixteenth century. There
are several inns, of which that called Old
Buchanan's was recommended to us, first,
by the recollection, that Mr. Gray had
mentioned it, and afterwards by the comfort
and civility we found there.</p>

<p>Some traces of the Scottish dialect and
pronunciation appear as far south as Lancashire;
in Westmoreland, they become
stronger; and, at Penrith, are extremely
distinct and general, serving for one among
many peaceful indications of an approach,
once notified chiefly by preparations for
hostility, or defence. Penrith is the most
southern town in England at which the
guinea notes of the Scotch bank are in circulation.
The beacon, a sort of square
tower, with a peaked roof and openings at
the sides, is a more perfect instance of the
direful necessities of past ages, than would
be expected to remain in this. The circumstances
are well known, which made
such watchfulness especially proper, at Penrith;
and the other traces of warlike habits
and precautions, whether appearing in records,
or buildings, are too numerous to be
noticed in a sketch, which rather pretends
to describe what the author has seen, than
to enumerate what has been discovered by
the researches of others. Dr. Burn's History
contains many curious particulars; and
there are otherwise abundant and satisfactory
memorials, as to the state of the debateable
ground, the regulations for securing
passes or fords, and even to the public
maintenance of slough dogs, which were
to pursue aggressors with hot trod, as the
inhabitants were to follow them by horn
and voice. These are all testimonies, that
among the many evils, inflicted upon countries
by war, that, which is not commonly
thought of, is not the least; the public encouragement
of a disposition to violence,
under the names of gallantry, or valour,
which will not cease exactly when it is
publicly prohibited; and the education of
numerous bodies to habits of supplying their
wants, not by constant and useful labour,
but by sudden and destructive exertions of
force. The mistake, by which courage is
released from all moral estimation of the
purposes, for which it is exerted, and is
considered to be necessarily and universally
a good in itself, rather than a means of
good, or of evil, according to its application,
is among the severest misfortunes of
mankind. Tacitus has an admirable reproof
of it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ubi manu agitur, modestia et probitas nomina
superioris sunt."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the situation of Penrith, looking
up the vales of Eden and Emont, is remarkably
pleasant, that of the beacon above
is infinitely finer, commanding an horizon
of at least an hundred miles diameter, filled
with an endless variety of beauty, greatness
and sublimity. The view extends over
Cumberland, parts of Westmoreland, Lancashire,
Yorkshire, and a corner of Northumberland
and Durham. On a clear day,
the Scottish high lands, beyond Solway
Firth, may be distinguished, like faint
clouds on the horizon, and the steeples of
Carlisle are plainly visible. All the intervening
country, speckled with towns and
villages, is spread beneath the eye, and,
nearly eighty miles to the eastward, part of
the Cheviot-hills are traced, a dark line,
binding the distance and marking the separation
between earth and sky. On the
plains towards Carlisle, the nearer ridges of
Cross-fell are seen to commence, and thence
stretch their barren steeps thirty miles towards
the east, where they disappear among
the Stainmore-hills and the huge moorlands
of Yorkshire, that close up the long landscape
of the vale of Eden. Among these,
the broken lines of Ingleborough start above
all the broader ones of the moors, and that
mountain still proclaims itself sovereign of
the Yorkshire heights.</p>

<p>Southward, rise the wonders of Westmoreland,
Shapfells, ridge over ridge, the
nearer pikes of Hawswater, and then the
mountains of Ullswater, Helvellyn pre-eminent
amongst them, distinguished by the
grandeur and boldness of their outline, as
well as the variety of their shapes; some
hugely swelling, some aspiring in clusters
of alpine points, and some broken into
shaggy ridges. The sky, westward from
hence and far to the north, displays a vision
of Alps, Saddleback spreading towards Keswick
its long shattered ridge, and one top
of Skiddaw peering beyond it; but the
others of this district are inferior in grandeur
to the fells of Ullswater, more broken
into points, and with less of contrast in their
forms. Behind Saddleback, the skirts of
Skiddaw spread themselves, and thence low
hills shelve into the plains of Cumberland,
that extend to Whitehaven; the only level
line in the scope of this vast horizon. The
scenery nearer to the eye exhibited cultivation
in its richest state, varied with pastoral
and sylvan beauty; landscapes embellished
by the elegancies of art, and rendered venerable
by the ruins of time. In the vale
of Eden, Carleton-hall, flourishing under the
hand of careful attention, and Bird's Nest,
luxuriant in its spiry woods, opposed their
cheerful beauties to the neglected walls of
Brougham Castle, once the terror, and, even
in ruins, the pride of the scene, now half-shrouded
in its melancholy grove. These
objects were lighted up by partial gleams
of sunshine, which, as they fled along
the valley, gave magical effect to all they
touched.</p>

<p>The other vales in the home prospect
were those of Bampton and Emont; the
first open and gentle, shaded by the gradual
woods of Lowther-park; the last closer and
more romantic, withdrawing in many a lingering
bend towards Ullswater, where it is
closed by the pyramidal Dunmallard, but
not before a gleam of the lake is suffered
to appear beyond the dark base of the hill.
At the nearer end of the vale, and immediately
under the eye, the venerable ruins of
Penrith Castle crest a round green hill.
These are of pale red stone, and stand in
detached masses; but have little that is
picturesque in their appearance, time having
spared neither tower, or gateway, and not
a single tree giving shade, or force, to the
shattered walls. The ground about the castle
is broken into grassy knolls, and only
cattle wander over the desolated tract. Time
has also obscured the name of the founder;
but it is known, that the main building was
repaired, and some addition made to it by
Richard the Third, when Duke of Gloucester,
who lived here, for five years, in his
office of sheriff of Cumberland, promoting
the York interest by artful hospitalities, and
endeavouring to strike terror into the Lancastrians.
Among the ruins is a subterraneous
passage, leading to a house in Penrith,
above three hundred yards distant, called
Dockwray Castle. The town lies between
the fortress and the Beacon-hill, spreading
prettily along the skirts of the mountain,
with its many roofs of blue slate, among
which the church rises near a dark grove.</p>

<p>Penrith, from the latter end of the last
century, till lately, when it was purchased
the Duke of Devonshire, belonged to
the family of Portland, to whom it was
given by William the Third; probably instead
of the manors in Wales, which it was
one of William's few faulty designs so have
given to his favourite companion, had not
Parliament remonstrated, and informed him,
that the Crown could not alienate the territories
of the Principality. The church, a
building of red stone, unusually well disposed
in the interior, is a vicarage of small
endowment; but the value of money in
this part of the kingdom is so high, that
the merit of independence, a merit and a
happiness which should always belong to
clergymen, is attainable by the possessors of
very moderate incomes. What is called
the Giant's Grave in the church yard is a
narrow spot, inclosed, to the length of fourteen
or fifteen feet, by rows of low stones,
at the sides, and, at the ends, by two pillars,
now slender, but apparently worn by
the weather from a greater thickness. The
height of these is eleven or twelve feet;
and all the stones, whether in the borders,
at the sides, or in these pillars, bear traces
of rude carving, which shew, at least, that
the monument must have been thought very
important by those that raised it, since the
singularity of its size was not held a sufficient
distinction. We pored intently over
these traces, though certainly without the
hope of discovering any thing not known
to the eminent antiquarians, who have confessed
their ignorance concerning the origin
of them.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="FROM_PENRITH_TO_KESWICK" id="FROM_PENRITH_TO_KESWICK">FROM PENRITH TO KESWICK.</a></h3>

<p>The Graystock road, which we took
for the first five or six miles, is uninteresting,
and offers nothing worthy of attention,
before the approach to the castle, the seat
of the Duke of Norfolk. The appearance
of this from the road is good; a gray building,
with gothic towers, seated in a valley
among lawns and woods, that stretch, with
great pomp of shade, to gently-rising hills.
Behind these, Saddleback, huge, gray and
barren, rises with all its ridgy lines; a grand
and simple back-ground, giving exquisite
effect to the dark woods below. Such is
the height of the mountain, that, though
eight or ten miles off, it appeared, as we
approached the castle, almost to impend over
it. Southward from Saddleback, a multitude
of pointed summits crowd the horizon;
and it is most interesting, after leaving
Graystock, to observe their changing attitudes,
as you advance, and the gradual disclosure
of their larger features. Perhaps, a
sudden display of the sublimest scenery,
however full, imparts less emotion, than a
gradually increasing view of it; when expectation
takes the highest tone, and imagination
finishes the sketch.</p>

<p>About two miles beyond Graystock, the
moorlands commence, and, as far as simple
greatness constitutes sublimity, this was, indeed,
a sublime prospect; less so only than
that from Shap-fell itself, where the mountains
are not so varied in their forms and
are plainer in their grandeur. We were
on a vast plain, if plain that may be called,
which swells into long undulations, surrounded
by an amphitheatre of heathy
mountains, that seem to have been shook
by some grand convulsion of the earth,
and tumbled around in all shapes. Not a
tree, a hedge, and seldom even a stone wall,
broke the grandeur of their lines; what was
not heath was only rock and gray crags;
and a shepherd's hut, or his flocks, browsing
on the steep sides of the fells, or in the narrow
vallies, that opened distantly, was all
that diversified the vast scene. Saddleback
spread his skirts westward along the plain,
and then reared himself in terrible and
lonely majesty. In the long perspective
beyond, were the crowding points of the
fells round Keswick, Borrowdale, and the
vales, of St. John and Leyberthwaite, stretching
away to those near Grasmere. The
weather was in solemn harmony with the
scenery; long shadows swept over the hills,
followed by gleaming lights. Tempestuous
gusts alone broke the silence. Now and
then, the sun's rays had a singular appearance;
pouring, from under clouds, between
the tops of fells into some deep vale, at a
distance, as into a focus.</p>

<p>This is the very region, which the wild
fancy of a poet, like Shakespeare, would
people with witches, and shew them at their
incantations, calling spirits from the clouds
and spectres from the earth.</p>

<p>On the now lonely plains of this vast
amphitheatre, the Romans had two camps,
and their Eagle spread its wings over a
scene worthy of its own soarings. The
lines of these encampments may still be
traced on that part of the plain, called Hutton
Moor, to the north of the high road;
and over its whole extent towards Keswick
a Roman way has been discovered. Funereal
urns have also been dug up here, and
an altar of Roman form, but with the inscription
obliterated.</p>

<p>Nearer Saddleback, we perceived crags
and heath mingling on its precipices, and
its base broken into a little world of mountains,
green with cultivation. White farms,
each with its grove to shelter it from the
descending gusts, corn and pastures of the
brightest verdure enlivened the skirts of the
mountain all round, climbing towards the
dark heath and crags, or spreading downwards
into the vale of Threlkeld, where
the slender Lowther shews his shining
stream.</p>

<p>Leaving Hutton Moor, the road soon
began to ascend the skirts of Saddleback,
and passed between green hillocks, where
cattle appeared most elegantly in the mountain
scene, under the crags, or sipping at
the clear stream, that gushed from the rocks,
and wound to the vale below. Such crystal
rivulets crossed our way continually,
as we rose upon the side of Saddleback,
which towers abruptly on the right, and, on
the left, sinks as suddenly into the vale of
Threlkeld, with precipices sometimes little
less than tremendous. This mountain is
the northern boundary of the vale in its
whole length to Keswick, the points of
whose fells close the perspective. Rocky
heights guard it to the south. The valley
between is green, without wood, and, with
much that is grand, has little beautiful, till
near its conclusion; where, more fertile
and still more wild, it divides into three
narrower vallies, two of which disclose
scenes of such sublime severity as even our
long view of Saddleback had not prepared
us to expect.</p>

<p>The first of these is the vale of St. John,
a narrow, cultivated spot, lying in the bosom
of tremendous rocks, that impend over
it in masses of gray crag, and often resemble
the ruins of castles. These rocks are
overlooked by still more awful mountains,
that fall in abrupt lines, and close up the
vista, except where they also are commanded
by the vast top of Helvellyn. On every
side, are images of desolation and stupendous
greatness, closing upon a narrow line
of pastoral richness; a picture of verdant
beauty, seen through a frame of rock work.
It is between the cliffs of Threlkeld-fell and
the purple ridge of Nadale-fell, that this
vale seems to repose in its most silent and
perfect peace. No village and scarcely a
cottage disturbs its retirement. The flocks,
that feed at the feet of the cliffs, and the
steps of a shepherd, "in this office of his
mountain watch," are all, that haunt the
"dark sequestered nook."</p>

<p>The vale of Nadale runs parallel with
that of St. John, from which it is separated
by the ridge of Nadale-fell, and has the
same style of character, except that it is
terminated by a well wooded mountain.
Beyond this, the perspective is overlooked
by the fells, that terminate the vale of St.
John.</p>

<p>The third valley, opening from the head
of Threlkeld, winds along the feet of Saddleback
and Skiddaw to Keswick, the approach
to which, with all its world of rocky
summits, the lake being still sunk below
the sight, is sublime beyond the power of
description. Within three miles of Keswick,
Skiddaw unfolds itself, close behind
Saddleback; their skirts unite, but the former
is less huge and of very different form
from the last; being more pointed and
seldomer broken into precipices, it darts upward
with a vast sweep into three spiry
summits, two of which only are seen from
this road, and shews sides dark with heath
and little varied with rock. Such is its aspect
from the Penrith road; from other
stations its attitude, shape and colouring are
very different, though its alpine terminations
are always visible.</p>

<p>Threlkeld itself is a small village, about
thirteen miles from Penrith, with a very
humble inn, at which those, who have
passed the bleak sides of Saddleback, and
those, who are entering upon them, may
rejoice to rest. We had been blown about,
for some hours, in an open chaise, and
hoped for more refreshment than could be
obtained; but had the satisfaction, which
was, indeed, general in these regions, of observing
the good intentions, amounting almost
to kindness, of the cottagers towards
their guests. They have nearly always some
fare, which less civility than theirs might
render acceptable; and the hearth blazes in
their clean sanded parlours, within two
minutes after you enter them. Some sort
of preserved fruit is constantly served after
the repast, with cream, an innocent luxury,
for which no animal has died.</p>

<p>It is not only from those, who are to
gain by strangers, but from almost every
person, accidentally accosted by a question,
that this favourable opinion will be formed,
as to the kind and frank manners of the
people. We were continually remarking,
between Lancaster and Keswick, that severe
as the winter might be in these districts,
from the early symptoms of it then apparent,
the conduct of the people would render
it scarcely unpleasant to take the same
journey in the depths of December.</p>

<p>In these countries, the farms are, for the
most part, small, and the farmers and their
children work in the same fields with their
servants. Their families have thus no opportunities
of temporary insight into the
society, and luxuries of the great, and have
none of those miseries, which dejected vanity
and multiplied wishes inflict upon the
pursuers of the higher ranks. They are
also without the baseness, which such pursuers
usually have, of becoming abject before
persons of one class, that by the authority
of an apparent connection with them,
they may be insolent to those of another;
and are free from the essential humiliation
of shewing, by a general and undistinguishing
admiration of all persons richer than
themselves, that the original distinctions between
virtue and vice have been erased
from their minds by the habit of comparing
the high and the low.</p>

<p>The true consciousness of independence,
which labour and an ignorance of the
vain appendages, falsely called luxuries,
give to the inhabitants of these districts, is
probably the cause of the superiority, perceived
by strangers in their tempers and
manners, over those of persons, apparently
better circumstanced. They have no remembrance
of slights, to be revenged by
insults; no hopes from servility, nor irritation
from the desire of unattainable distinctions.
Where, on the contrary, the encouragement
of artificial wants has produced
dependence, and mingled with the fictitious
appearance of wealth many of the most
real evils of poverty, the benevolence of
the temper flies with the simplicity of
the mind. There is, perhaps, not a more
odious prospect of human society, than
where an ostentatious, man&oelig;uvring and
corrupted peasantry, taking those, who induce
them to crimes, for the models of
their morality, mimic the vices, to which
they were not born, and attempts the coarse
covering of cunning and insolence for
practices, which it is a science and frequently
an object of education to conceal
by flagitious elegancies. Such persons form
in the country a bad copy of the worst
London society; the vices, without the
intelligence, and without the assuaging
virtues.</p>

<h3><a name="DRUIDICAL_MONUMENT" id="DRUIDICAL_MONUMENT">DRUIDICAL MONUMENT.</a></h3>

<p>After passing the very small, but
neatly furnished church of Threlkeld, the
condition of which may be one testimony
to the worthiness of the neighbourhood,
and rising beyond the vales before described,
we came to the brow of a hill, called Castle
Rigg, on which, to the left of the road, are
the remains of one of those circular monuments,
which, by general consent, are called
Druids' Temples. This is formed of thirty-seven
stones, placed in a circle of about
twenty-eight yards diameter, the largest
being not less than seven feet and a half
high, which is double the height of the
others. At the eastern part of this circle, and
within it, smaller stones are arranged in an
oblong of about seven yards long, and, at
the greatest breadth, four yards wide. Many
of those round the circle appear to have
fallen and now remain at unequal distances,
of which the greatest is towards the north.</p>

<p>Whether our judgment was influenced
by the authority of a Druid's choice, or
that the place itself commanded the opinion,
we thought this situation the most severely
grand of any hitherto passed. There is,
perhaps, not a single object in the scene,
that interrupts the solemn tone of feeling,
impressed by its general characters of profound
solitude, greatness and awful wildness.
Castle Rigg is the central point of
three vallies, that dart immediately under
it from the eye, and whose mountains form
part of an amphitheatre, which is completed
by those of Derwentwater, in the west, and
by the precipices of Skiddaw and Saddleback,
close on the north. The hue, which
pervades all these mountains, is that of dark
heath, or rock; they are thrown into every
form and direction, that Fancy would suggest,
and are at that distance, which allows
all their grandeur to prevail; nearer than
the high lands, that surround Hutton Moor,
and further removed than the fells in the
scenery of Ullswater.</p>

<p>To the south open the rocks, that disclose
the vale of St. John, whose verdant
beauty bears no proportion to its sublimity;
to the west, are piled the shattered and fantastic
points of Derwentwater; to the north,
Skiddaw, with its double top, resembling
a volcano, the cloudy vapours ascending
from its highest point, like smoke, and
sometimes rolling in wreaths down its sides;
and to the east, the vale of Threlkeld,
spreading green round the base of Saddleback,
its vast side-skreen, opened to the
moorlands, beyond which the ridge of
Cross-fell appeared; its dignity now diminished
by distance. This point then is surrounded
by the three grand rivals of Cumberland;
huge Helvellyn, spreading Saddleback
and spiry Skiddaw.</p>

<p>Such seclusion and sublimity were, indeed,
well suited to the deep and wild mysteries
of the Druids. Here, at moon-light,
every Druid, summoned by that terrible
horn, never awakened but upon high occasions,
and descending from his mountain,
or secret cave, might assemble without intrusion
from one sacrilegious footstep, and
celebrate a midnight festival by a savage
sacrifice&mdash;</p>

<p>As we descended the steep mountain to
Keswick, the romantic fells round the lake
opened finely, but the lake itself was concealed,
deep in its rocky cauldron. We saw
them under the last glow of sun-set, the
upward rays producing a misty purple glory
between the dark tops of Cawsey-pikes and
the bending peaks of Thornthwaite fells.
Soon after, the sun having set to the vale
of Keswick, there appeared, beyond breaks
in its western mountains, the rocks of other
vallies, still lighted up by a purple gleam,
and receiving strong rays on shaggy points,
to which their recesses gave soft and shadowy
contrast. But the magical effect of these
sunshine rocks, opposed to the darkness of
the nearer valley, can scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p>Still as we descended, the lake of Derwentwater
was screened from our view;
but the rich level of three miles wide, that
spreads between it and Bassenthwaite-water
in the same vale, lay, like a map, beneath
us, chequered with groves and cottages,
with enclosures of corn and meadows, and
adorned by the pretty village of Crossthwaite,
its neat white church conspicuous
among trees. The fantastic fells of Derwentwater
bordered this reposing landscape,
on the west, and the mighty Skiddaw rose
over it, on the east, concealing the lake of
Bassenthwaite.</p>

<p>The hollow dashings of the Greta, in its
rocky channel, at the foot of Skiddaw, and
in one of the most wizard little glens that
nature ever fancied, were heard long before
we looked down its steep woody bank, and
saw it winding away, from close inaccessible
chasms, to the vale of Keswick, corn and
meadows spread at the top of the left bank,
and the crags of Skiddaw scowling over it,
on the right.</p>

<p>At length, we had a glimpse of the
north end of Derwentwater, and soon after
entered Keswick, a small place of stone
houses, lying at the foot of Castle Rigg,
near Skiddaw, and about a quarter of a mile
from the lake, which, however, is not seen
from the town.</p>

<p>We were impatient to view this celebrated
lake, and immediately walked down
to Crow-park, a green eminence at its
northern end, whence it is generally allowed
to appear to great advantage. Expectation
had been raised too high: Shall we
own our disappointment? Prepared for
something more than we had already seen,
by what has been so eloquently said of it,
by the view of its vast neighbourhood and
the grandeur of its approach, the lake itself
looked insignificant; and, however rude, or
awful, its nearer rocks might have appeared,
if seen unexpectedly, they were not in general
so vast, or so boldly outlined, as to
retain a character of sublimity from comparison.
Opposed to the simple majesty of
Ullswater, the lake of Derwent was scarcely
interesting. Something must, indeed, be
attributed to the force of first impressions;
but with all allowance for this, Ullswater
must still retain an high pre-eminence for
grandeur and sublimity.</p>

<p>Derwentwater, however, when more minutely
viewed, has peculiar charms both
from beauty and wildness, and as the emotions,
excited by disappointed expectation,
began to subside, we became sensible of
them. It seems to be nearly of a round
form, and the whole is seen at one glance,
expanding within an amphitheatre of mountains,
rocky, but not vast, broken into many
fantastic shapes, peaked, splintered, impending,
sometimes pyramidal, opening by narrow
vallies to the view of rocks, that rise
immediately beyond and are again overlooked
by others. The precipices seldom
overshoot the water, but are arranged at
some distance, and the shores swell with
woody eminences, or sink into green, pastoral
margins. Masses of wood also frequently
appear among the cliffs, feathering
them to their summits, and a white cottage
sometimes peeps from out their skirts, seated
on the smooth knoll of a pasture, projecting
to the lake, and looks so exquisitely picturesque,
as to seem placed there purposely to
adorn it. The lake in return faithfully
reflects the whole picture, and so even and
brilliantly translucent is its surface, that it
rather heightens, than obscures the colouring.
Its mild bosom is spotted by four
small islands, of which those called Lords'
and St. Herbert's are well wooded, and
adorn the scene, but another is deformed by
buildings, stuck over it, like figures upon a
twelfth-cake.</p>

<p>Beyond the head of the lake, and at a
direct distance of three or four miles from
Crow-park, the pass of Borrowdale opens,
guarded by two piles of rock, the boldest in
the scene, overlooked by many rocky points,
and, beyond all, by rude mountain tops
which come partially and in glimpses to the
view. Among the most striking features
of the eastern shore are the woody cliffs of
Lowdore; then, nearer to the eye, Wallow-crags,
a title used here as well as at
Hawswater, of dark brown rock, loosely
impending; nearer still, Castle-hill, pyramidal
and richly wooded to its point, the
most luxuriant feature of the landscape.
Cawsey-pike, one of the most remarkable
rocks of the western shore, has its ridge
scolloped into points as if with a row of
corbells.</p>

<p>The cultivated vale of Newland slopes
upward from the lake between these and
Thornthwaite fells. Northward, beyond
Crow-park, rises Skiddaw; at its base commences
the beautiful level, that spreads to
Bassenthwaite-water, where the rocks in the
west side of the perspective soon begin to
soften, and the vale becomes open and
cheerful.</p>

<p>Such is the outline of Derwentwater,
which has a much greater proportion of
beauty, than Ullswater, but neither its dignity,
nor grandeur. Its fells, broken into
smaller masses, do not swell, or start, into
such bold lines as those of Ullswater; nor
does the size of the lake accord with the
general importance of the rocky vale, in
which it lies. The water is too small for
its accompaniments; and its form, being
round and seen entirely at once, leaves nothing
for expectation to pursue, beyond the
stretching promontory, or fancy to transform
within the gloom and obscurity of the
receding fell; and thus it loses an ample
source of the sublime. The greatest breadth
from east to west is not more than three
miles. It is not large enough to occupy
the eye, and it is not so hidden as to have
the assistance of the imagination in making
it appear large. The beauty of its banks
also, contending with the wildness of its
rocks, gives opposite impressions to the
mind, and the force of each is, perhaps,
destroyed by the admission of the other.
Sublimity can scarcely exist, without simplicity;
and even grandeur loses much of
its elevating effect, when united with a
considerable portion of beauty; then descending
to become magnificence. The
effect of simplicity in assisting that high
tone of mind, produced by the sublime, is
demonstrated by the scenery of Ullswater,
where very seldom a discordant object obtrudes
over the course of thought, and jars
upon the feelings.</p>

<p>But it is much pleasanter to admire than
to examine, and in Derwentwater is abundant
subject for admiration, though not of
so high a character as that, which attends
Ullswater. The soft undulations of its
shores, the mingled wood and pasture, that
paint them, the brilliant purity of the water,
that gives back every landscape on its bank,
and frequently with heightened colouring,
the fantastic wildness of the rocks and the
magnificence of the amphitheatre they
form; these are circumstances, the view of
which excites emotions of sweet, though
tranquil admiration, softening the mind to
tenderness, rather than elevating it to sublimity.
We first saw the whole beneath
such sober hues as prevailed when</p>

<p>The wildness, seclusion, and magical

<h3><a name="SKIDDAW" id="SKIDDAW">SKIDDAW.</a></h3>

<p>On the following morning, having
engaged a guide, and with horses accustomed
to the labour, we began to ascend
this tremendous mountain by a way, which
makes the summit five miles from Keswick.
Passing through bowery lanes, luxuriant
with mountain ash, holly, and a variety of
beautiful shrubs, to a broad, open common,
a road led us to the foot of Latrigg, or, as
it is called by the country people, Skiddaw's
Cub, a large round hill, covered with heath,
turf and browsing sheep. A narrow path
now wound along steep green precipices,
the beauty of which prevented what danger
there was from being perceived. Derwentwater
was concealed by others, that rose
above them, but that part of the vale of
Keswick, which separates the two lakes, and
spreads a rich level of three miles, was immediately
below; Crossthwaite-church, nearly
in the centre, with the white vicarage,
rising among trees. More under shelter of
Skiddaw, where the vale spreads into a sweet
retired nook, lay the house and grounds of
Dr. Brownrigg.</p>

<p>Beyond the level, opened a glimpse of
Bassenthwaite-water; a lake, which may be
called elegant, bounded, on one side, by
well-wooded rocks, and, on the other, by
Skiddaw.</p>

<p>Soon after, we rose above the steeps,
which had concealed Derwentwater, and it
appeared with all its enamelled banks, sunk
deep amidst a chaos of mountains, and surrounded
by ranges of fells, not visible from
below. On the other hand, the more cheerful
lake of Bassenthwaite expanded at its
entire length. Having gazed a while on
this magnificent scene, we pursued the path,
and soon after reached the brink of a chasm,
on the opposite side of which wound our
future track; for the ascent is here in an
acutely zig-zag direction. The horses carefully
picked their steps along the narrow
precipice, and turned the angle, that led
them to the opposite side.</p>

<p>At length, as we ascended, Derwentwater
dwindled on the eye to the smallness of a
pond, while the grandeur of its amphitheatre
was increased by new ranges of dark
mountains, no longer individually great, but
so from accumulation; a scenery to give
ideas of the breaking up of a world. Other
precipices soon hid it again, but Bassenthwaite
continued to spread immediately below
us, till we turned into the heart of
Skiddaw, and were enclosed by its steeps.
We had now lost all track even of the
flocks, that were scattered over these tremendous
wilds. The guide conducted us
by many curvings among the heathy hills
and hollows of the mountain; but the ascents
were such, that the horses panted in
the slowest walk, and it was necessary to
let them rest every six or seven minutes.
An opening to the south, at length, shewed
the whole plan of the narrow vales of St.
John and of Nadale, separated by the dark
ridge of rock, called St. John's rigg, with
each its small line of verdure at the bottom,
and bounded by enormous gray fells, which
we were, however, now high enough to
overlook.</p>

<p>A white speck, on the top of St. John's
rigg, was pointed out by the guide to be a
chapel of ease to Keswick, which has no
less than five such, scattered among the fells.
From this chapel, dedicated to St. John, the
rock and the vale have received their name,
and our guide told us, that Nadale was frequently
known by the same title.</p>

<p>Leaving this view, the mountain soon
again shut out all prospect, but of its own
vallies and precipices, covered with various
shades of turf and moss, and with heath, of
which a dull purple was the prevailing hue.
Not a tree, or bush appeared on Skiddaw,
nor even a stone wall any where broke the
simple greatness of its lines. Sometimes,
we looked into tremendous chasms, where
the torrent, heard roaring long before it
was seen, had worked itself a deep channel,
and fell from ledge to ledge, foaming and
shining amidst the dark rock. These streams
are sublime from the length and precipitancy
of their course, which, hurrying the
sight with them into the abyss, act, as it
were, in sympathy upon the nerves, and,
to save ourselves from following, we recoil
from the view with involuntary horror.
Of such, however, we saw only two, and
those by some departure from the usual
course up the mountain; but every where
met gushing springs, till we were within
two miles of the summit, when our guide
added to the rum in his bottle what he said
was the last water we should find in our
ascent.</p>

<p>The air now became very thin, and the
steeps still more difficult of ascent; but it
was often delightful to look down into
the green hollows of the mountain, among
pastoral scenes, that wanted only some mixture
of wood to render them enchanting.</p>

<p>About a mile from the summit, the way
was, indeed, dreadfully sublime, laying, for
nearly half a mile, along the ledge of a
precipice, that passed, with a swift descent,
for probably near a mile, into a glen within
the heart of Skiddaw; and not a bush, or a
hillock interrupted its vast length, or, by
offering a mid-way check in the descent,
diminished the fear it inspired. The ridgy
steeps of Saddleback, formed the opposite
boundary of the glen, and, though really
at a considerable distance, had, from the
height of the two mountains, such an appearance
of nearness, that it almost seemed
as if we could spring to its side. How
much too did simplicity increase the sublime
of this scenery, in which nothing but
mountain, heath and sky appeared!</p>

<p>But our situation was too critical, or too
unusual, to permit the just impressions of
such sublimity. The hill rose so closely
above the precipice as scarcely to allow a
ledge wide enough for a single horse. We
followed the guide in silence, and, till we
regained the more open wild, had no leisure
for exclamation. After this, the ascent appeared
easy and secure, and we were bold
enough to wonder, that the steeps near the
beginning of the mountain had excited any
anxiety.</p>

<p>At length, passing the skirts of the two
points of Skiddaw, which are nearest to
Derwentwater, we approached the third and
loftiest, and then perceived, that their steep
sides, together with the ridges, which connect
them, were entirely covered near the
summits with a whitish shivered slate, which
threatens to slide down them with every
gust of wind. The broken state of this
slate makes the present summits seem like
the ruins of others; a circumstance as extraordinary
in appearance as difficult to be
accounted for.</p>

<p>The ridge, on which we passed from
the neighbourhood of the second summit to
the third, was narrow, and the eye reached;
on each side, down the whole extent of
the mountain, following, on the left, the
rocky precipices, that impend over the lake
of Bassenthwaite, and looking, on the right,
into the glens of Saddleback, far, far below.
But the prospects, that burst upon us from
every part of the vast horizon, when we
had gained the summit, were such as we
had scarcely dared to hope for, and must
now rather venture to enumerate, than to
describe.</p>

<p>We stood on a pinnacle, commanding
the whole dome of the sky. The prospects
below, each of which had been before
considered separately as a great scene,
were now miniature parts of the immense
landscape. To the north, lay, like a map,
the vast tract of low country, which extends
between Bassenthwaite and the Irish Channel,
marked with the silver circles of the
river Derwent, in its progress from the
lake. Whitehaven and its white coast were
distinctly seen, and Cockermouth seemed
almost under the eye. A long blackish
line, more to the west, resembling a faintly
formed cloud, was said by the guide to be
the Isle of Man, who, however, had the
honesty to confess, that the mountains of
Down in Ireland, which have been sometimes
thought visible, had never been seen
by him in the clearest weather.</p>

<p>Bounding the low country to the north,
the wide Solway Firth, with its indented
shores, looked like a gray horizon, and the
double range of Scottish mountains, seen
dimly through mist beyond, like lines of
dark clouds above it. The Solway appeared
surprisingly near us, though at fifty miles
distance, and the guide said, that, on a
bright day, its shipping could plainly be
discerned. Nearly in the north, the heights
seemed to soften into plains, for no object
was there visible through the obscurity, that
had begun to draw over the furthest distance;
but, towards the east, they appeared
to swell again, and what we were told
were the Cheviot hills dawned feebly beyond
Northumberland. We now spanned
the narrowest part of England, looking from
the Irish Channel, on one side, to the German
Ocean, on the other, which latter was,
however, so far off as to be discernible only
like a mist.</p>

<p>Nearer than the county of Durham,
stretched the ridge of Cross-fell, and an indistinct
multitude of the Westmoreland and
Yorkshire highlands, whose lines disappeared
behind Saddleback, now evidently pre-eminent
over Skiddaw, so much so as to
exclude many a height beyond it. Passing
this mountain in our course to the south,
we saw, immediately below, the fells round
Derwentwater, the lake itself remaining
still concealed in their deep rocky bosom.
Southward and westward, the whole prospect
was a "turbulent chaos of dark mountains."
All individual dignity was now
lost in the immensity of the whole, and
every variety of character was overpowered
by that of astonishing and gloomy grandeur.</p>

<p>Over the fells of Borrowdale, and far to
the south, the northern end of Windermere
appeared, like a wreath of gray smoke, that
spreads along the mountain's side. More
southward still, and beyond all the fells of
the lakes, Lancaster sands extended to the
faintly seen waters of the sea. Then to the
west, Duddon sands gleamed in a long line
among the fells of High Furness. Immediately
under the eye, lay Bassenthwaite,
surrounded by many ranges of mountains,
invisible from below. We overlooked all
these dark mountains, and saw green cultivated
vales over the tops of lofty rocks, and
other mountains over these vales in many
ridges, whilst innumerable narrow glens
were traced in all their windings and seen
uniting behind the hills with others, that
also sloped upwards from the lake.</p>

<p>The air on this summit was boisterous,
intensely cold and difficult to be inspired,
though the day was below warm and serene.
It was dreadful to look down from nearly
the brink of the point, on which we stood,
upon the lake of Bassenthwaite and over a
sharp and separated ridge of rocks, that
from below appeared of tremendous height,
but now seemed not to reach half way up
Skiddaw; it was almost as if</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent">
<span class="ind2">"the precipitation might down stretch</span><br />
Below the beam of sight."
</p>
</div>

<p>Under the lee of an heaped up pile of
slates, formed by the customary contribution
of one from every visitor, we found an old
man sheltered, whom we took to be a shepherd,
but afterwards learned was a farmer
and, as the people in this neighbourhood
say, a 'statesman'; that is, had land of his
own. He was a native and still an inhabitant
of an adjoining vale; but, so laborious
is the enterprise reckoned, that, though
he had passed his life within view of the
mountain, this was his first ascent. He descended
with us, for part of our way, and
then wound off towards his own valley,
stalking amidst the wild scenery, his large
figure wrapt in a dark cloak and his steps
occasionally assisted by a long iron pronged
pike, with which he had pointed out distant
objects.</p>

<p>In the descent, it was interesting to observe
each mountain below gradually re-assuming
its dignity, the two lakes expanding
into spacious surfaces, the many little
vallies, that sloped upwards from their margins,
recovering their variegated tints of
cultivation, the cattle again appearing in
the meadows, and the woody promontories
changing from smooth patches of shade into
richly tufted summits. At about a mile
from the top, a great difference was perceptible
in the climate, which became comparatively
warm, and the summer hum of
bees was again heard among the purple
heath.</p>

<p>We reached Keswick, about four o'clock,
after five hours passed in this excursion, in
which the care of our guide greatly lessened
the notion of danger. Why should we
think it trivial to attempt some service towards
this poor man? We have reason to
think, that whoever employs, at Keswick, a
guide of the name of Doncaster, will assist
him in supporting an aged parent.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="BASSENTHWAITE_WATER" id="BASSENTHWAITE_WATER">BASSENTHWAITE WATER.</a></h3>

<p>In a gray autumnal morning, we
rode out along the western bank of Bassenthwaite
to Ouse Bridge, under which the
river Derwent, after passing through the
lake, takes its course towards the Sea. The
road on this side, being impassable by carriages,
is seldom visited, but it is interesting
for being opposed to Skiddaw, which rises
in new attitudes over the opposite bank.
Beyond the land, that separates the two
lakes, the road runs high along the sides
of hills and sometimes at the feet of tremendous
fells, one of which rises almost
spirally over it, shewing a surface of slates,
shivered from top to bottom. Further on,
the heights gradually soften from horror
into mild and graceful beauty, opening distantly
to the cheerful country that spreads
towards Whitehaven; but the road soon
immerges among woods, which allow only
partial views of the opposite shore, inimitably
beautiful with copses, green lawns and
pastures, with gently sweeping promontories
and bays, that receive the lake to their full
brims.</p>

<p>From the house at Ouse Bridge the prospect
is exquisite up the lake, which now
losing the air of a wide river, re-assumes
its true character, and even appears to flow
into the chasm of rocks, that really inclose
Derwentwater. Skiddaw, with all the mountains
round Borrowdale, form a magnificent
amphitheatrical perspective for this noble
sheet of water; the vallies of the two
lakes extending to one view, which is,
therefore, superior to any exhibited from
Derwentwater alone. The prospect terminates
in the dark fells of Borrowdale, which
by their sublimity enhance the beauty and
elegance, united to a surprising degree in
the nearer landscape.</p>

<p>Beyond Ouse Bridge, but still at the bottom
of the lake, the road passes before Armithwaite-house,
whose copsy lawns slope
to the margin of the water from a mansion
more finely situated than any we had seen.
It then recedes somewhat from the bank,
and ascends the skirt of Skiddaw, which it
scarcely leaves on this side of Keswick. On
the opposite shore, the most elegant features
are the swelling hills, called Wythop-brows,
flourishing with wood from the water's
edge; and, below the meadows of the eastern
bank, by which we were returning, two
peninsul&aelig;, the one pastoral, yet well wooded
and embellished by a white hamlet, the
other narrow and bearing only a line of
trees, issuing far into the lake. But the
shores of Bassenthwaite, though elegant and
often beautiful, are too little varied to be
long dwelt upon; and attention is sometimes
unpleasantly engaged by a precipice,
from which the road is not sufficiently secured;
so that the effect of the whole
upon the imagination is much less than
might be expected from its situation at
the foot of Skiddaw, and its shape, which
is more extended than that of Derwentwater.</p>

<h3><a name="BORROWDALE" id="BORROWDALE">BORROWDALE.</a></h3>

<p>A serene day, with gleams of sunshine,
gave magical effect to the scenery of
Derwentwater, as we wound along its eastern
shore to Borrowdale, under cliffs, parts
of which, already fallen near the road, increased
the opinion of danger from the rest;
sometimes near the edge of precipices, that
bend over the water, and, at others, among
pleasure-grounds and copses, which admit
partial views over the lake. These, with
every woody promontory and mountain,
were perfectly reflected on its surface. Not
a path-way, not a crag, or scar, that sculptured
their bold fronts, but was copied and
distinctly seen even from the opposite shore
in the dark purple mirror below. Now
and then, a pleasure-boat glided by, leaving
long silver lines, drawn to a point on the
smooth water which, as it gave back the
painted sides and gleaming sail, displayed a
moving picture.</p>

<p>The colouring of the mountains was, this
day, surprisingly various and changeful, surpassing
every thing of the same nature, that
we had seen. The effect of the atmosphere
on mountainous regions is sometimes
so sublime, at others so enchantingly beautiful,
that the mention of it ought not to be
considered as trivial, when their aspect is to
be described. As the sun-beams fell on
different kinds of rock, and distance coloured
the air, some parts were touched with
lilac, others with light blue, dark purple,
or reddish brown, which were often seen,
at the same moment, contrasting with the
mellow green of the woods and the brightness
of sunshine; then slowly and almost
imperceptibly changing into other tints.
Skiddaw itself exhibited much of this variety,
during our ride. As we left Keswick,
its points were overspread with pale
azure; on our return, a tint of dark blue
softened its features, which were, however,
soon after involved in deepest purple.</p>

<p>Winding under the woods of Barrowside,
we approached Lowdore, and heard the
thunder of his cataract, joined by the sounds
of others, descending within the gloom of
the nearer rocks and thickets. The retrospective
views over the lake from Barrowside
are the finest in the ride; and, when
the road emerges from the woods, a range
of rocks rises over it, where many shrubs,
and even oaks, ash, yew, grow in a surprising
manner among the broken slates,
that cover their sides. Beyond, at some
distance from the shore, appear the awful
rocks, that rise over the fall of Lowdore;
that on the right shooting up, a vast pyramid
of naked cliff, above finely wooded
steeps; while, on the opposite side of the
chasm, that receives the waters, impends
Gowdar-crag, whose trees and shrubs give
only shagginess to its terrible masses, with
fragments of which the meadows below are
strewn. There was now little water at
Lowdore; but the breadth of its channel
and the height of the perpendicular rock,
from which it leaps, told how tremendous
it could be; yet even then its sublimity is
probably derived chiefly from the cliff and
mountain, that tower closely over it.</p>

<p>Here Borrowdale begins, its rocks spreading
in a vast sweep round the head of the
lake, at the distance, perhaps, of half a mile
from the shore, which bears meadow land
to the water's brink. The aspect of these
rocks, with the fragments, that have rolled
from their summits, and lie on each side of
the road, prepared us for the scene of tremendous
ruin we were approaching in the
gorge, or pass of Borrowdale, which opens
from the centre of the amphitheatre, that
binds the head of Derwentwater. Dark
rocks yawn at its entrance, terrific as the
wildness of a maniac; and disclose a narrow
pass, running up between mountains of
granite, that are shook into almost every
possible form of horror. All above resembles
the accumulations of an earthquake;
splintered, shivered, piled, amassed. Huge
cliffs have rolled down into the glen below,
where, however, is still a miniature of the
sweetest pastoral beauty, on the banks of
the river Derwent; but description cannot
paint either the wildness of the mountains
or the pastoral and sylvan peace and softness,
that wind at their base.</p>

<p>Among the most striking of the fells are
Glaramara, shewing rock on rock; and
Eagle-crag, where, till lately, that bird built
its nest; but the depredations, annually
committed on its young, have driven it
from the place. Hence we pursued the pass
for a mile, over a frightful road, that climbs
among the crags of a precipice above the
river, having frequently glimpses into glens
and chasms, where all passage seemed to be
obstructed by the fallen shivers of rock,
and at length reached the gigantic stone of
Bowther, that appears to have been pitched
into the ground from the summit of a
neighbouring fell, and is shaped, like the
roof of a house reversed.</p>

<p>This is one of the spectacles of the country.
Its size makes it impossible to have
been ever moved by human means; and,
if it fell from the nearest of the rocks, it
must have rolled upon the ground much
further than can be readily conceived of the
motion of such a mass. The side towards
the road projects about twelve feet over the
base, and serves to shelter cattle in a penn,
of which it is made to form one boundary.
A small oak plant and a sloe have found soil
enough to flourish in at the top; and the
base is pitched on a cliff over the river,
whence a long perspective of the gorge is
seen, with a little level of bright verdure,
spreading among more distant fells and
winding away into trackless regions, where
the mountains lift their ruffian heads in undisputed
authority. Below, the shrunk
Derwent serpentized along a wide bed of
pebbles, that marked its wintry course, and
left a wooded island, flourishing amidst the
waste. The stillness around us was only
feebly broken by the remote sounds of
many unseen cataracts, and sometimes by
the voices of mountaineer children, shouting
afar off, and pleasing themselves with
rousing the echoes of the rocks.</p>

<p>In returning, the view opened, with great
magnificence, from the jaws of this pass
over the lake to Skiddaw, then seen from
its base, with the upper steeps of Saddleback
obliquely beyond, and rearing itself far
above all the heights of the eastern shore.
At the entrance of the gorge, the village
or hamlet of Grange lies picturesquely on
the bank of the Derwent among wood and
meadows, and sheltered under the ruinous
fell, called Castle-crag, that takes its name
from the castle, or fortress, which from its
crown once guarded this important pass.</p>

<p>Borrowdale abounds in valuable mines,
among which some are known to supply
the finest wadd, or black lead, to be found
in England. Iron, slate, and free stone of
various kinds, are also the treasures of these
mountains.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_KESWICK_TO_WINDERMERE" id="FROM_KESWICK_TO_WINDERMERE">FROM KESWICK TO WINDERMERE.</a></h3>

<p>The road from Keswick to Ambleside
commences by the ascent of Castle-rigg,
the mountain, which the Penrith road
descends, and which, on that side, is crowned
by a Druid's temple. The rise is now
very laborious, but the views it affords over
the vale of Keswick are not dearly purchased
by the fatigue. All Bassenthwaite,
its mountains softening away in the perspective,
and terminating, on the west, in
the sister woods of Wythop-brows, extends
from the eye; and, immediately beneath,
the northern end of Derwentwater, with
Cawsey-pike, Thornthwaite-fell, the rich
upland vale of Newland peeping from between
their bases, and the spiry woods of
Foepark jutting into the lake below. But
the finest prospect is from a gate about halfway
up the hill, whence you look down
upon the head of Derwentwater, with all
the alps of Borrowdale, opening darkly.</p>

<p>After descending Castle-rigg and crossing
the top of St. John's vale, we seemed as
going into banishment from society, the
road then leading over a plain, closely surrounded
by mountains so wild, that neither
a cottage, or a wood soften their rudeness,
and so steep and barren, that not even sheep
appear upon their sides. From this plain
the road enters Legberthwaite, a narrow
valley, running at the back of Borrowdale,
green at the bottom, and varied with a
few farms, but without wood, and with
fells of gray precipices, rising to great height
and nearly perpendicular on either hand,
whose fronts are marked only by the torrents,
that tumble from their utmost summits,
and perpetually occur. We often
stopped to listen to their hollow sounds
amidst the solitary greatness of the scene,
and to watch their headlong fall down the
rocky chasms, their white foam and silver
line contrasting with the dark hue of the
clefts. In sublimity of descent these were
frequently much superior to that of Lowdore,
but as much inferior to it in mass of
water and picturesque beauty.</p>

<p>As the road ascended towards Helvellyn,
we looked back through this vast rocky
vista to the sweet vale of St. John, lengthening
the perspective, and saw, as through
a telescope, the broad broken steeps of Saddleback
and the points of Skiddaw, darkly
blue, closing it to the north. The grand
rivals of Cumberland were now seen together;
and the road, soon winding high
over the skirts of Helvellyn, brought us to
Leathes-water, to which the mountain forms
a vast side-skreen, during its whole length.
This is a long, but narrow and unadorned
lake, having little else than walls of rocky
fells, starting from its margin. Continuing
on the precipice, at some height from the
shore, the road brought us, after three miles,
to the poor village of Wythburn, and soon
after to the foot of Dunmail Rays, which,
though a considerable ascent, forms the dip
of two lofty mountains, Steel-fell and Seat
Sandle, that rise with finely-sweeping lines,
on each side, and shut up the vale.</p>

<p>Beyond Dunmail Rays, one of the grand
passes from Cumberland into Westmoreland,
Helm-crag rears its crest, a strange fantastic
summit, round, yet jagged and splintered,
like the wheel of a water-mill, overlooking
Grasmere, which, soon after, opened below.
A green spreading circle of mountains embosoms
this small lake, and, beyond, a wider
range rises in amphitheatre, whose rocky
tops are rounded and scolloped, yet are
great, wild, irregular, and were then overspread
with a tint of faint purple. The
softest verdure margins the water, and mingles
with corn enclosures and woods, that
wave up the hills; but scarcely a cottage
any where appears, except at the northern
end of the lake, where the village of Grasmere
and its very neat white church stand
among trees, near the shore, with Helm-crag
and a multitude of fells, rising over
it and beyond each other in the perspective.</p>

<p>The lake was clear as glass, reflecting
the headlong mountains, with every feature
of every image on its tranquil banks; and
one green island varies, but scarcely adorns
its surface, bearing only a rude and now
shadeless hut. At a considerable height
above the water, the road undulates for a
mile, till, near the southern end of Grasmere,
it mounts the crags of a fell, and
seemed carrying us again into such scenes
of ruin and privation as we had quitted
with Legberthwaite and Leathes-water.
But, descending the other side of the
mountain, we were soon cheered by the
view of plantations, enriching the banks of
Rydal-water, and by thick woods, mingling
among cliffs above the narrow lake,
which winds through a close valley, for
about a mile. This lake is remarkable for
the beauty of its small round islands, luxuriant
with elegant trees and shrubs, and
whose banks are green to the water's edge.
Rydal-hall stands finely on an eminence,
somewhat withdrawn from the east end, in
a close romantic nook, among old woods,
that feather the fells, which rise over their
summits and spread widely along the
neighbouring eminences. This antient white
mansion looks over a rough grassy descent,
screened by groves of oak and majestic
planes, towards the head of Windermere,
about two miles distant, a small glimpse of
which is caught beyond the wooded steeps
of a narrow valley. In the woods and in
the disposition of the ground round Rydal-hall
there is a charming wildness, that
suits the character of the general scene;
and, wherever art appears, it is with graceful
plainness and meek subjection to nature.</p>

<p>The taste, by which a cascade in the
pleasure-grounds, pouring under the arch
of a rude bridge, amidst the green tint of
woods, is shewn through a darkened garden-house,
and, therefore, with all the effect,
which the opposition of light and shade can
give, is even not too artificial; so admirably
is the intent accomplished of making all the
light, that is admitted, fall upon the objects,
which are chiefly meant to be observed.</p>

<p>The road to Ambleside runs through the
valley in front of Rydal-hall, and for some
distance among the grounds that belong to
it, where again the taste of the owner is
conspicuous in the disposition of plantations
among pastures of extraordinary richness,
and where pure rivulets are suffered to
wind without restraint over their dark rocky
channels. Woods mantle up the cliffs on
either side of this sweet valley, and, higher
still, the craggy summits of the fells crowd
over the scene. Two miles among its
pleasant shades, near the banks of the murmuring
Rotha, brought us to Ambleside,
a black and very antient little town, hanging
on the lower steeps of a mountain,
where the vale opens to the head of</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="WINDERMERE" id="WINDERMERE">WINDERMERE,</a></h3>

<p>Which appeared at some distance
below, in gentle yet stately beauty; but its
boundaries shewed nothing of the sublimity
and little of the romantic wildness, that
charms, or elevates in the scenery of the
other lakes. The shores, and the hills,
which gradually ascend from them, are in
general richly cultivated, or wooded, and
correctly elegant; and when we descended
upon the bank the road seemed leading
through the artificial shades of pleasure-grounds.
It undulates for two miles over
low promontories and along spacious bays,
full to their fringed margin with the abundance
of this expansive lake; then, quitting
the bank, it ascends gradual eminences, that
look upon the vast plain of water, and rise
amidst the richest landscapes of its shores.
The manners of the people would have
sufficiently informed us that Windermere
is the lake most frequented; and with the
great sublimity of the more sequestered
scenes, we had to regret the interesting
simplicity of their inhabitants, a simplicity
which accorded so beautifully with the dignified
character of the country. The next
day, we visited several of the neighbouring
heights, whence the lake is seen to great
advantage; and, on the following, skirted
the eastern shore for six miles to the
Ferry.</p>

<p>Windermere, above twelve miles long
and generally above a mile broad, but sometimes
two, sweeps like a majestic river with
an easy bend between low points of land
and eminences that, shaded with wood and
often embellished with villas, swell into hills
cultivated to their summits; except that, for
about six miles along the middle of the western
shore, a range of rocky fells rise over
the water. But these have nothing either
picturesque or fantastic in their shape; they
are heavy, not broken into parts, and their
rudeness softens into insignificance, when
they are seen over the wide channel of the
lake; they are neither large enough to be
grand, or wooded enough to be beautiful.
To the north, or head of Windermere,
however, the tameness of its general character
disappears, and the scene soars into
grandeur. Here, over a ridge of rough
brown hills above a woody shore, rise, at
the distance of a mile and half, or two
miles, a multitude of finely alpine mountains,
retiring obliquely in the perspective,
among which Langdale-pikes, Hardknot
and Wry-nose, bearing their bold, pointed
promontories aloft, are pre-eminent. The
colouring of these mountains, which are
some of the grandest of Cumberland and
Westmoreland, was this day remarkably
fine. The weather was showery, with
gleams of sunshine; sometimes their tops
were entirely concealed in gray vapours,
which, drawing upwards, would seem to
ascend in volumes of smoke from their
summits; at others, a few scattered clouds
wandered along their sides leaving their
heads unveiled and effulgent with light.
These clouds disappearing before the
strength of the sun, a fine downy hue of
light blue overspread the peeping points of
the most distant fells, while the nearer ones
were tinged with deep purple, which was
opposed to the brown heath and crag of
the lower hills, the olive green of two
wooded slopes that, just tinted by autumn,
seemed to descend to the margin, and the
silver transparency of the expanding water
at their feet. This view of Windermere
appears with great majesty from a height
above Culgarth, a seat of the Bishop of
Landaff; while, to the south, the lake after
sweeping about four miles gradually narrows
and disappears behind the great island,
which stretches across the perspective.</p>

<p>At the distance of two or three miles
beyond Culgarth, from a hill advancing
towards the water, the whole of Windermere
is seen; to the right, is the white
mansion at Culgarth, among wood, on a
gentle eminence of the shore, with the lake
spreading wide beyond, crowned by the
fells half obscured in clouds. To the south,
the hills of the eastern shore, sloping gradually,
run out in elegant and often well
wooded points into the water, and are
spotted with villas and varied above with
enclosures. The opposite shore is for about
a mile southward a continuation of the line
of rock before noticed, from which Rawlinson's-nab
pushes a bold headland over the
lake; the perspective then sinks away in
low hills, and is crossed by a remote ridge,
that closes the scene.</p>

<p>The villages of Rayrig and Bowness,
which are passed in the way to the Ferry,
both stand delightfully; one on an eminence
commanding the whole lake, and the
other within a recess of the shore, nearly
opposite the large island. The winding
banks of Windermere continually open new
landscapes as you move along them, and
the mountains, which crown its head, are
as frequently changing their attitudes; but
Langdale-pikes, the boldest features in the
scene, are soon lost to the eye behind the
nearer fells of the western shore.</p>

<p>The ferry is considerably below Christian's
island, and at the narrowest span of the
lake, where two points of the shore extend
to meet each other. This island, said to contain
thirty acres, intermingled with wood,
lawn and shrubberies, embellishes, without
decreasing the dignity of the scene; it is
surrounded by attendant islets, some rocky,
but others, beautifully covered with wood,
seem to coronet the flood.</p>

<p>In crossing the water the illusions of
vision give force to the northern mountains,
which viewed from hence appear to
ascend from its margin and to spread round
it in a magnificent amphitheatre. This was
to us the most interesting view on Windermere.</p>

<p>On our approaching the western shore,
the range of rocks that form it, discovered
their cliffs, and gradually assumed a consequence,
which the breadth of the channel
had denied them; and their darkness was
well opposed by the bright verdure and variegated
autumnal tints of the isles at their
base. On the bank, under shelter of these
rocks, a white house was seen beyond the
tall boles of a most luxuriant grove of plane-trees,
which threw their shadows over it,
and on the margin of the silver lake spreading
in front. From hence the road ascends
the steep and craggy side of Furness-fell,
on the brow of which we had a last view
of Windermere, in its whole course; to the
south, its tame but elegant landscapes gliding
away into low and long perspective,
and the lake gradually narrowing; to the
north, its more impressive scenery; but the
finest features of it were now concealed by
a continuation of the rocks we were upon.</p>

<p>Windermere is distinguished from all the
other lakes of this country by its superior
length and breadth, by the gentle hills, cultivated
and enclosed nearly to their summits,
that generally bind its shores, by the
gradual distance and fine disposition of the
northern mountains, by the bold sweeps of
its numerous bays, by the villas that speckle
and rich plantations, that wind them, and by
one large island, surrounded by many islets,
which adds dignity to its bosom. On the
other lakes the islands are prettinesses, that
do not accord with the character of the
scene; they break also the surface of the
water where vast continuity is required; and
the mind cannot endure to descend suddenly
from the gigantic sublimity of nature to
her fairy sports. Yet, on the whole, Windermere
was to us the least impressive of
all the lakes. Except to the north, where
the retiring mountains are disposed with
uncommon grandeur of outline and magnificence
of colouring, its scenery is tame,
having little of the wild and nothing of the
astonishing energy that appears on the features
of the more sequestered districts. The
characters of the three great lakes may, perhaps,
be thus distinguished:</p>

<p>Windermere: Diffusiveness, stately beauty,
and, at the upper end, magnificence.</p>

<p>Ullswater: Severe grandeur and sublimity;
all that may give ideas of vast power
and astonishing majesty. The effect of Ullswater
is, that, awful as its scenery appears,
it awakens the mind to expectation still
more awful, and, touching all the powers
of imagination, inspires that "fine phrensy"
descriptive of the poet's eye, which not only
bodies forth unreal forms, but imparts to
substantial objects a character higher than
their own.</p>

<p>Derwentwater: Fantastic wildness and
romantic beauty, but inferior to Ullswater
in greatness, both of water and rocks; for,
though it charms and elevates, it does not
display such features and circumstances of
the sublime, or call up such expectation of
unimaged and uncertain wonder. A principal
defect, if we may venture to call it so,
of Derwentwater is, that the water is too
small in proportion for the amphitheatre of
the valley in which it lies, and therefore
loses much of the dignity, that in other circumstances
it would exhibit. The fault of
Windermere is, perhaps, exactly the reverse;
where the shores, not generally grand,
are rendered tamer by the ample expanse of
the lake. The proportions of Ullswater are
more just, and, though its winding form
gives it in some parts the air of a river, the
abrupt and tremendous height of its rocks,
the dark and crowding summits of the fells
above, the manner in which they enclose it,
together with the dignity of its breadth, empower
it constantly to affect the mind with
emotions of astonishment and lofty expectation.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_WINDERMERE_TO_HAWKSHEAD" id="FROM_WINDERMERE_TO_HAWKSHEAD">FROM WINDERMERE TO HAWKSHEAD,
THURSTON-LAKE AND ULVERSTON.</a></h3>

<p>After ascending the laborious crags
and precipices of Furness-fell, enlivened,
however, by frequent views of the southern
end of Windermere, the road immediately
descends the opposite side of the mountain,
which shuts out the beautiful scenery of the
lake; but the prospect soon after opens to
other mountains of Furness, in the distance,
which revive the expectation of such sublimity
as we had lately regretted, and to
Esthwait-water in the valley below. This
is a narrow, pleasant lake, about half a mile
broad and two miles long, with gradual hills,
green to their tops, rising round the margin;
with plantations and pastures alternately
spreading along the easy shores, and white
farms scattered sparingly upon the slopes
above. The water seems to glide through
the quiet privacy of pleasure-grounds; so
fine is the turf on its banks, so elegant its
copses, and such an air of peace and retirement
prevails over it. A neat white village
lies at the feet of the hills near the head of
the lake; beyond it is the gray town of
Hawkshead, with its church and parsonage
on an eminence commanding the whole
valley. Steep hills rise over them, and,
more distant, the tall heads of the Coniston-fells,
dark and awful, with a confusion
of other mountains.</p>

<p>Hawkshead, thus delightfully placed, is
an antient, but small town, with a few good
houses, and a neat town-house, lately built
by subscriptions, of which the chief part
was gratefully supplied by London merchants,
who had been educated at the free
school here; and this school itself is a memorial
of gratitude, having been founded
by Archbishop Sandys for the advantage of
the town, which gave him birth. Near
Hawkshead are the remains of the house,
where the Abbot of Furness "kept residence
by one or more monks, who performed
divine service and other parochial
duties in the neighbourhood." There is
still a court-room over the gateway, "where
the bailiff of Hawkshead held court, and
distributed justices in the name of the
abbot."</p>

<p>From the tremendous steeps of the long
fell, which towers over Hawkshead, astonishing
views open to the distant vales and
mountains of Cumberland; overlooking all
the grotesque summits in the neighbourhood
of Grasmere, the fells of Borrowdale
in the furthest distance, Langdale-pikes, and
several small lakes, seen gleaming in the
bosom of the mountains. Before us, rose
the whole multitude of Coniston-fells; of
immense height and threatening forms,
their tops thinly darkened with thunder
mists, and, on the left, Furness-fells sinking
towards the bay, which Ulverston sands
form for the sea.</p>

<p>As we advanced, Coniston-fells seemed
to multiply, and became still more impressive,
till, having reached at length the summit
of the mountain, we looked down upon
Thurston-lake immediately below, and saw
them rising abruptly round its northern end
in somewhat of the sublime attitudes and
dark majesty of Ullswater. A range of
lowers rocks, nearer to the eye, exhibited
very peculiar and grotesque appearance, coloured
scars and deep channels marking
their purple sides, as if they had been rifted
by an earthquake.</p>

<p>The road descends the flinty steeps towards
the eastern bank of the lake, that
spreads a surface of six miles in length
and generally three quarters of a mile in
breadth, not winding in its course, yet
much indented with bays, and presenting
nearly its whole extent at once to the eye.
The grandest features are the fells, that
crown its northern end, not distantly and
gradually, like those of Windermere, nor
varied like them with magnificent colouring,
but rising in haughty abruptness, dark,
rugged and stupendous, within a quarter of
a mile of the margin, and shutting out all
prospect of other mountain-summits. At
their feet, pastures spread a bright green to
the brim of the lake. Nearly in the centre
of these fells, which open in a semicircle
to receive the lake, a cataract descends, but
its shining line is not of a breadth proportioned
to the vastness of its perpendicular
fall. The village of Coniston is sweetly
seated under shelter of the rocks; and,
at a distance beyond, on the edge of the
water, the antient hall, or priory, shews its
turret and ivyed ruins among old woods.
The whole picture is reflected in the liquid
mirror below. The gay, convivial
chorus, or solemn vesper, that once swelled
along the lake from these consecrated walls,
and awakened, perhaps, the enthusiasm of
the voyager, while evening stole upon the
scene, is now contrasted by desolation and
profound repose, and, as he glides by, he
hears only the dashing of his oars, or the
surge beating on the shore.</p>

<p>This lake appeared to us one of the most
charming we had seen. From the sublime
mountains, which bend round its head, the
heights, on either side, decline towards the
south into waving hills, that form its shores,
and often stretch in long sweeping points
into the water, generally covered with
tufted wood, but sometimes with the tender
verdure of pasturage. The tops of these
woods were just embrowned with autumn,
and contrasted well with other slopes, rough
and heathy, that rose above, or fell beside
them to the water's brink, and added force
to the colouring, which the reddish tints of
decaying fern, the purple bloom of heath,
and the bright golden gleams of broom,
spread over these elegant banks. Their
hues, the graceful undulations of the marginal
hills and bays, the richness of the
woods, the solemnity of the northern fells
and the deep repose, that pervades the scene,
where only now and then a white cottage
or a farm lurks among the trees, are circumstances,
which render Thurston-lake one
of the most interesting and, perhaps, the
most beautiful of any in the country.</p>

<p>The road undulates over copsy hills, and
dips into shallow vallies along the whole of
the eastern bank, seldom greatly elevated
above the water, or descending to a level
with it, but frequently opening to extensive
views of its beauties, and again shrouding
itself in verdant gloom. The most impressive
pictures were formed by the fells, that
crowd over the upper end of the lake, and
which, viewed from a low station, sometimes
appeared nearly to enclose that part of
it. The effect was then astonishingly grand,
particularly about sun-set, when the clouds,
drawing upwards, discovered the utmost
summits of these fells, and a tint of dusky
blue began to prevail over them, which
gradually deepened into night. A line of
lower rocks, that extend from these, are,
independently of the atmosphere, of a dull
purple, and their shaggy forms would appear
gigantic in almost any other situation.
Even here, they preserve a wild dignity,
and their attitudes somewhat resemble those
at the entrance of Borrowdale; but they
are forgotten, when the eye is lifted to the
solemn mountains immediately above. These
are rich in slate quarries, and have some
copper mines; but the latter were closed,
during the civil wars of the last century,
having been worked, as we are told in the
descriptive language of the miners, from <i>the
day to the evening end</i>, forty fathom, and
to the <i>morning end</i> seven score fathom; a
figurative style of distinguishing the western
and eastern directions of the mine. The
lake, towards the lower end, narrows and
is adorned by one small island; but here
the hills of the eastern shore soar into fells,
some barren, craggy and nearly perpendicular,
others entirely covered with coppice-wood.
Two of these, rising over the road,
gave fine relief to each other, the one shewing
only precipices of shelving rock, while
its rival aspired with woods, that mantled
from the base to the summit, consisting
chiefly of oak, ash and holly. Not any
lake, that we saw, is at present so much
embellished with wood as Thurston. All
the mountains of <i>High</i> and the vallies of
<i>Low Furness</i> were, indeed, some centuries
ago, covered with forests, part of which was
called the Forest of Lancaster; and these
were of such entangled luxuriance as to be
nearly impenetrable in many tracts. Here,
wolves, wild boars, and a remarkably large
breed of deer, called Leghs, the heads of
which have frequently been found buried
at a considerable depth in the soil, abounded.
So secure an asylum did these animals
find in the woods of High Furness, that,
even after the low lands were cleared and
cultivated, shepherds were necessary to
guard the flocks from the ravages of the
wolves. Towards the end of the thirteenth
century, the upper forests also were nearly
destroyed.</p>

<p>In winter, the shepherds used to feed
their stocks with the young sprouts of ash
and holly, a custom said to be still observed;
the sheep coming at the call of the shepherd
and assembling round the holly-tree
to receive from his hand the young shoots
cropped for them<a href="#fn2"><span class="small"><sup>2</sup></span></a><a name="fn2r" id="fn2r"></a>. Whenever the woods
are felled, which is too frequently done, to
supply fuel for the neighbouring furnaces,
the holly is still held sacred to the flocks of
these mountains.</p>

<p>Soon after passing the island, the road
enters the village of Nibthwaite, rich only
in situation; for the cottages are miserable.
The people seemed to be as ignorant as
poor; a young man knew not how far it
was to Ulverston, or as he called it Ulson,
though it was only five miles.</p>

<p>On the point of a promontory of the
opposite shore, embosomed in ancient
woods, the chimnies and pointed roof of
a gray mansion look out most interestingly.
The woods open partially to the
north, and admit a view of the <i>Swiss</i>
scenery at the head of the lake, in its fine
position. On the other sides, the oaks so
embower the house and spread down the
rocks, as scarcely to allow it a glimpse of
the water bickering between the dark foliage
below.</p>

<p>At Nibthwaite, the lake becomes narrow
and gradually decreases, till it terminates at
Lowick-bridge, where it glides away in the
little river Crake, which descends to Ulverston
sands. We stopped upon the bridge
to take a last view of the scene; the distant
fells were disappearing in twilight, but the
gray lake gleamed at their base. From the
steeps of a lofty mountain, that rose near
us on the right, cattle were slowly descending
for the night, winding among the crags,
sometimes stopping to crop the heath, or
broom, and then disappearing for a moment
behind the darker verdure of yews, that
grew in knots upon the cliffs.</p>

<p>It was night before we reached Ulverston.
The wind sounded mournfully among
the hills and we perceived our approach
to the sea only by the faint roaring of the
tide, till from a brow, whence the hills open
on either hand with a grand sweep, we
could just discern the gray surface of the
sea-bay, at a distance below, and then, by
lights that glimmered in the bottom, the
town of Ulverston, lying not far from the
shore and screened on the north by the
heights, from which we were to descend.</p>

<p>Ulverston is a neat but ancient town, the
capital and chief port of Furness. The road
from it to the majestic ruin of Furness Abbey
lies through Low Furness, and loses the
general wildness and interest of the country,
except where now and then the distant retrospect
of the mountains breaks over the
tame hills and regular enclosures, that border
it.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half on this side of
the Abbey, the road passes through Dalton,
a very ancient little town, once the capital
of Low Furness, and rendered so important
by its neighbourhood to the Abbey,
that Ulverston, the present capital, could not
then support the weekly market, for which
it had obtained a charter. Dalton, however,
sunk with the suppression of its neighbouring
patrons, and is now chiefly distinguished
by the pleasantness of its situation, to which
a church, built on a bold ascent, and the remains
of a castle, advantageously placed for
the command of the adjoining valley, still
attach some degree of dignity. What now
exists of the latter is one tower, in a chamber
of which the Abbot of Furness held his
secular Court; and the chamber was afterwards
used as a gaol for debtors, till within
these few years, when the dead ruin released
the living one. The present church-yard
and the scite of this castle are supposed to
have been included within the limits of a
<i>castellum</i>, built by Agricola, of the fosse of
which there are still some faint vestiges.</p>

<p>Beneath the brow, on which the church
and tower stand, a brook flows through a
narrow valley, that winds about a mile and
a half to the Abbey. In the way thither
we passed the entrance of one of the very
rich iron mines, with which the neighbourhood
abounds; and the deep red tint of the
soil, that overspreads almost the whole country
between Ulverston and the monastery,
sufficiently indicates the nature of the treasures
beneath.</p>

<p>In a close glen, branching from this valley,
shrouded by winding banks clumped
with old groves of oak and chesnut, we
found the magnificent remains of</p>

<hr class="tiny" />
<h3><a name="FURNESS_ABBEY" id="FURNESS_ABBEY">FURNESS ABBEY.</a></h3>

<p>The deep retirement of its situation,
the venerable grandeur of its gothic arches
and the luxuriant yet ancient trees, that
shadow this forsaken spot, are circumstances
of picturesque and, if the expression may be
allowed, of sentimental beauty, which fill
the mind with solemn yet delightful emotion.
This glen is called the Vale of Nightshade,
or, more literally from its ancient
title Bekangs-gill, the "glen of deadly
nightshade," that plant being abundantly
found in the neighbourhood. Its romantic
gloom and sequestered privacy particularly
adapted it to the austerities of monastic
life; and in the most retired part of it King
Stephen, while Earl of Mortaign and Bulloign,
founded, in the year 1127, the magnificent
monastery of Furness, and endowed
it with princely wealth and almost princely
authority, in which it was second only to
Fontain's-abbey in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The windings of the glen conceal these
venerable ruins, till they are closely approached,
and the bye road, that conducted us, is
margined with a few ancient oaks, which
stretch their broad branches entirely across
it, and are finely preparatory objects to the
scene beyond. A sudden bend in this road
brought us within view of the northern gate
of the Abbey, a beautiful gothic arch, one
side of which is luxuriantly festooned with
nightshade. A thick grove of plane-trees,
with some oak and beech, overshadow it on
the right, and lead the eye onward to the
ruins of the Abbey, seen through this dark
arch in remote perspective, over rough but
verdant ground. The principal features are
the great northern window and part of the
eastern choir, with glimpses of shattered
arches and stately walls beyond, caught between
the gaping casements. On the left,
the bank of the glen is broken into knolls
capped with oaks, which in some places
spread downwards to a stream that winds
round the ruin, and darken it with their rich
foliage. Through this gate is the entrance
to the immediate precincts of the Abbey,
an area said to contain sixty-five acres, now
called the Deer-park. It is enclosed by a
stone wall, on which the remains of many
small buildings and the faint vestiges of
others, still appear; such as the porter's
lodge, mills, granaries, ovens and kilns that
once supplied the monastery, some of which,
seen under the shade of the fine old trees,
that on every side adorn the broken steeps
of this glen, have a very interesting effect.</p>

<p>Just within the gate, a small manor house
of modern date, with its stables and other
offices, breaks discordantly upon the lonely
grandeur of the scene. Except this, the
character of the deserted ruin is scrupulously
preserved in the surrounding area;
no spade has dared to level the inequalities,
which fallen fragments have occasioned in
the ground, or shears to clip the wild fern
and underwood, that overspread it; but
every circumstance conspires to heighten the
solitary grace of the principal object and to
prolong the luxurious melancholy, which
the view of it inspires. We made our way
among the pathless fern and grass to the
north end of the church, now, like every
other part of the Abbey, entirely roofless,
but shewing the lofty arch of the great window,
where, instead of the painted glass
that once enriched it, are now tufted plants
and wreaths of nightshade. Below is the
principal door of the church, bending into
a deep round arch, which, retiring circle
within circle, is rich and beautiful; the remains
of a winding stair-case are visible
within the wall on its left side. Near this
northern end of the edifice are seen one side
of the eastern choir, with its two slender
gothic window frames, and on the west a
remnant of the nave of the Abbey and
some lofty arches, which once belonged to
the belfry, now detached from the main
building.</p>

<p>To the south, but concealed from this
point of view, are the chapter-house, some
years ago exhibiting a roof of beautiful gothic
fretwork, and which was almost the
only part of the Abbey thus ornamented, its
architecture having been characterised by
an air of grand simplicity rather than by
the elegance and richness of decoration,
which in an after date distinguished the gothic
style in England. Over the chapter-house
were once the library and scriptorium,
and beyond it are still the remains of cloisters
of the refectory, the locutorium, or
conversation-room, and the calefactory.
These, with the walls of some chapels, of
the vestry, a hall, and of what is believed
to have been a school-house, are all the features
of this noble edifice that can easily be
traced: winding stair-cases within the surprising
thickness of the walls, and door-cases
involved in darkness and mystery, the place
abounds with.</p>

<p>The abbey, which was formerly of such
magnitude as nearly to fill up the breadth
of the glen, is built of a pale-red stone, dug
from the neighbouring rocks, now changed
by time and weather to a tint of dusky
brown, which accords well with the hues
of plants and shrubs that every where emboss
the mouldering arches.</p>

<p>The finest view of the ruin is on the east
side, where, beyond the vast, shattered frame
that once contained a richly-painted window,
is seen a perspective of the choir and
of distant arches, remains of the nave of the
abbey, closed by the woods. This perspective
of the ruin is<a href="#fn3"><span class="small"><sup>3</sup></span></a><a name="fn3r" id="fn3r"></a> said to be two hundred
and eighty-seven feet in length; the choir
part of it is in width only twenty-eight feet
inside, but the nave is seventy: the walls, as
they now stand, are fifty-four feet high and
in thickness five. Southward from the choir
extend the still beautiful, though broken,
pillars and arcades of some chapels, now
laid open to the day; the chapter-house,
the cloisters, and beyond all, and detached
from all, is the school-house, a large building,
the only part of the monastery that still
boasts a roof.</p>

<p>As, soothed by the venerable shades and
the view of a more venerable ruin, we rested
opposite to the eastern window of the choir,
where once the high altar stood, and, with
five other altars, assisted the religious pomp
of the scene; the images and the manners
of times, that were past, rose to reflection.
The midnight procession of monks,
clothed in white and bearing lighted tapers,
appeared to the "mind's eye" issuing to
the choir through the very door-case, by
which such processions were wont to pass
from the cloisters to perform the matin service,
when, at the moment of their entering
the church, the deep chanting of voices
was heard, and the organ swelled a solemn
peal. To fancy, the strain still echoed
feebly along the arcades and died in the
breeze among the woods, the rustling leaves
mingling with the close. It was easy to
image the abbot and the officiating priests
seated beneath the richly-fretted canopy of
the four stalls, that still remain entire in
the southern wall, and high over which is
now perched a solitary yew-tree, a black
funereal memento to the living of those who
once sat below.</p>

<p>Of a quadrangular court on the west side
of the church, three hundred and thirty-four
feet long and one hundred and two
feet wide, little vestige now appears, except
the foundation of a range of cloisters, that
formed its western boundary, and under
the shade of which the monks on days of
high solemnity passed in their customary
procession round the court. What was the
belfry is now a huge mass of detached ruin,
picturesque from the loftiness of its shattered
arches and the high inequalities of the
ground within them, where the tower, that
once crowned this building, having fallen,
lies in vast fragments, now covered with
earth and grass, and no longer distinguishable
but by the hillock they form.</p>

<p>The school-house, a heavy structure attached
to the boundary wall on the south,
is nearly entire, and the walls, particularly
of the portal, are of enormous thickness,
but, here and there, a chasm discloses the
stair-cases, that wind within them to chambers
above. The school-room below, shews
only a stone bench, that extends round the
walls, and a low stone pillar in the eastern
corner, on which the teacher's pulpit was
formerly fixed. The lofty vaulted roof is
scarcely distinguishable by the dusky light
admitted through one or two narrow windows
placed high from the ground, perhaps
for the purpose of confining the scholar's
attention to his book.</p>

<p>These are the principal features, that remain
of this once magnificent abbey. It
was dedicated to St. Mary, and received a
colony of monks from the monastery of
Savigny in Normandy, who were called
Gray Monks, from their dress of that colour,
till they became Cistercians, and, with
the severe rules of St. Bernard, adopted a
white habit, which they retained till the
dissolution of monastic orders in England.
The original rules of St. Bernard partook
in several instances of the austerities of those
of La Trapp, and the society did not very
readily relinquish the milder laws of St.
Benedict for the new rigours imposed upon
them by the parent monastery of Savigny.
They were forbidden to taste flesh, except
when ill, and even eggs, butter, cheese and
milk, but on extraordinary occasions; and
denied even the use of linen and fur. The
monks were divided into two classes, to
which separate departments belonged.&mdash;
Those, who attended the choir, slept upon
straw in their usual habits, from which, at
midnight, they rose and passed into the
church, where they continued their holy
hymns, during the short remainder of the
night. After this first mass, having publicly
confessed themselves, they retired to
their cells, and the day was employed in
spiritual exercises and in copying or illuminating
manuscripts. An unbroken silence
was observed, except when, after dinner,
they withdrew into the locutorium, where
for an hour, perhaps, they were permitted
the common privilege of social beings.
This class was confined to the boundary
wall, except that, on some particular days,
the members of it were allowed to walk
in parties beyond it, for exercise and amusement;
but they were very seldom permitted
either to receive, or pay visits. Like
the monks of La Trapp, however, they
were distinguished for extensive charities
and liberal hospitality; for travellers were
so scrupulously entertained at the Abbey,
that it was not till the dissolution that an
inn was thought necessary in this part of
Furness, when one was opened for their
accommodation, expressly because the monastery
could no longer receive them.</p>

<p>To the second class were assigned the cultivation
of the lands, and the performance
of domestic affairs in the monastery.</p>

<p>This was the second house in England,
that received the Bernardine rules, the most
rigorous of which were, however, dispensed
with in 1485 by Sixtus the Fourth, when,
among other indulgences, the whole order
was allowed to taste meat on three days
of the week. With the rules of St. Benedict,
the monks had exchanged their gray habit
for a white cassock with a white caul and
scapulary. But their choir dress was either
white or gray, with caul and scapulary of
the same, and a girdle of black wool; over
that a mozet, or hood, and a rochet<a href="#fn4"><span class="small"><sup>4</sup></span></a><a name="fn4r" id="fn4r"></a>.
When they went abroad they wore a caul
and full black hood.</p>

<p>The privileges and immunities, granted
to the Cistercian order in general, were very
abundant; and those, to the Abbey of Furness
were proportioned to its vast endowments.
The abbot, it has been mentioned,
held his secular court in the neighbouring
castle of Dalton, where he presided with
the power of administering not only justice
but injustice, since the lives and property of
the villain tenants of the lordship of Furness
were consigned by a grant of King
Stephen to the disposal of my lord abbot!
The monks also could be arraigned, for
whatever crime, only by him. "The military
establishment of Furness likewise depended
on the abbot. Every mesne lord
and free homager, as well as the customary
tenants, took an oath of fealty to the abbot,
to be true to him against all men, excepting
the king. Every mesne lord obeyed the
summons of the abbot, or his steward, in
raising his quota of armed men, and every
tenant of a whole tenement furnished a man
and horse of war for guarding the coast, for
the border-service, or any expedition against
the common enemy of the king and kingdom.
The habiliments of war were a steel
coat, or coat of mail, a falce, or falchion,
a jack, the bow, the bill, the cross-bow and
spear. The Furness legion consisted of
four divisions:&mdash;one of bowmen horsed
and harnessed; bylmen horsed and harnessed;
bowmen without horse and harness;
bylmen without horse and harness<a href="#fn5"><span class="small"><sup>5</sup></span></a><a name="fn5r" id="fn5r"></a>."</p>

<p>The deep forests, that once surrounded
the Abbey, and overspread all Furness, contributed
with its insulated situation, on a
neck of land running out into the sea, to
secure it from the depredations of the Scots,
who were continually committing hostilities
on the borders. On a summit over the
Abbey are the remains of a beacon, or
watch-tower, raised by the society for their
further security. It commands extensive
views over Low Furness and the bay of
the sea immediately beneath; looking forward
to the town and castle of Lancaster,
appearing faintly on the opposite coast; on
the south, to the isles of Wanley, Foulney,
and their numerous islets, on one of which
stands Peel-castle; and, on the north, to the
mountains of High Furness and Coniston,
rising in grand amphitheatre round this
inlet of the Irish Channel. Description can
scarcely suggest the full magnificence of
such a prospect, to which the monks, emerging
from their concealed cells below, occasionally
resorted to sooth the asperities,
which the severe discipline of superstition
inflicted on the temper; or, freed from
the observance of jealous eyes, to indulge,
perhaps, the sigh of regret, which a consideration
of the world they had renounced,
thus gloriously given back to their sight,
would sometimes awaken.</p>

<p>From Hawcoat, a few miles to the west
of Furness, the view is still more extensive,
whence, in a clear day, the whole length of
the Isle of Man may be seen, with part of
Anglesey and the mountains of Caernarvon,
Merionethshire, Denbighshire and Flintshire,
shadowing the opposite horizon of
the channel.</p>

<p>The sum total of all rents belonging to
the Abbey immediately before the dissolution,
was 946l. 2s. 10d. collected from Lancashire,
Cumberland, and even from the
Isle of Man; a sum, which considering the
value of money at that period; and the
woods, meadows, pastures, and fisheries,
retained by the society in their own hands;
the quantity of provisions for domestic use
brought by the tenants instead of rent,
and the shares of mines, mills, and salt-works,
which belonged to the Abbey, swells
its former riches to an enormous amount.</p>

<p>Pyle, the last abbot, surrendered with
twenty-nine monks, to Henry the Eighth,
April the 9th 1537, and in return was
made Rector of Dalton, a situation then
valued at thirty-three pounds six shillings
and eight-pence a year.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_ULVERSTON_TO_LANCASTER" id="FROM_ULVERSTON_TO_LANCASTER">FROM ULVERSTON TO LANCASTER.</a></h3>

<p>From the Abbey we returned to
Ulverston, and from thence crossed the
sands to Lancaster, a ride singularly interesting
and sublime. From the Carter's
house, which stands on the edge of the
Ulverston sands, and at the point, whence
passengers enter them, to Lancaster, within
the furthest opposite shore, is fifteen miles.
This noble bay is interrupted by the peninsula
of Cartmel, extending a line of
white rocky coast, that divides the Leven
and Ulverston sands from those of Lancaster.
The former are four miles over;
the latter seven.</p>

<p>We took the early part of the tide, and
entered these vast and desolate plains before
the sea had entirely left them, or the morning
mists were sufficiently dissipated to allow
a view of distant objects; but the grand
sweep of the coast could be faintly traced,
on the left, and a vast waste of sand stretching
far below it, with mingled streaks of
gray water, that heightened its dreary aspect.
The tide was ebbing fast from our
wheels, and its low murmur was interrupted,
first, only by the shrill small cry of seagulls,
unseen, whose hovering flight could
be traced by the sound, near an island that
began to dawn through the mist; and then,
by the hoarser croaking of sea-geese, which
took a wider range, for their shifting voices
were heard from various quarters of the
surrounding coast. The body of the sea,
on the right, was still involved, and the distant
mountains on our left, that crown the
bay, were also viewless; but it was sublimely
interesting to watch the heavy vapours
beginning to move, then rolling in
lengthening volumes over the scene, and, as
they gradually dissipated, discovering through
their veil the various objects they had concealed&mdash;fishermen
with carts and nets stealing
along the margin of the tide, little boats
putting off from the shore, and, the view
still enlarging as the vapours expanded, the
main sea itself softening into the horizon,
with here and there a dim sail moving in
the hazy distance. The wide desolation of
the sands, on the left, was animated only
by some horsemen riding remotely in
groups towards Lancaster, along the winding
edge of the water, and by a muscle-fisher
in his cart trying to ford the channel
we were approaching.</p>

<p>The coast round the bay was now distinctly,
though remotely, seen, rising in
woods, white cliffs and cultivated slopes towards
the mountains of Furness, on whose
dark brows the vapours hovered. The
shore falls into frequent recesses and juts out
in promontories, where villages and country
seats are thickly strewn. Among the latter,
Holker-hall, deep among woods, stands
in the north. The village and hall of Bardsea,
once the site of a monastery, with a
rocky back-ground and, in front, meadows
falling towards the water; and Conishead
priory, with its spiry woods, the paragon
of beauty, lie along the western coast,
where the hills, swelling gently from the isle
of Walney, nearly the last point of land
visible on that side the bay, and extending
to the north, sweep upwards towards the
fells of High Furness and the whole assemblage
of Westmoreland mountains, that
crown the grand boundary of this arm of
the sea.</p>

<p>We set out rather earlier than was necessary,
for the benefit of the guide over part
of these trackless wastes, who was going to
his station on a sand near the first ford,
where he remains to conduct passengers
across the united streams of the rivers Crake
and Leven, till the returning tide washes
him off. He is punctual to the spot as
the tides themselves, where he shivers in
the dark comfortless midnights of winter,
and is scorched on the shadeless sands,
under the noons of summer, for a stipend of
ten pounds a year! and he said that he
had fulfilled the office for thirty years. He
has, however, perquisites occasionally from
the passengers. In early times the Prior of
Conishead, who established the guide, paid
him with three acres of land and an annuity
of fifteen marks; at the dissolution, Henry
the Eighth charged himself and his successors
with the payment of the guide by patent.</p>

<p>Near the first ford is Chapel Isle, on the
right from Ulverston, a barren sand, where
are yet some remains of a chapel, built by
the monks of Furness, in which divine service
was daily performed at a certain hour,
for passengers, who crossed the sands with
the morning tide. The ford is not thought
dangerous, though the sands frequently
shift, for the guide regularly tries for, and
ascertains, the proper passage. The stream
is broad and of formidable appearance,
spreading rapidly among the sands and,
when you enter it, seeming to bear you
away in its course to the sea. The second
ford is beyond the peninsula of Cartmel,
on the Lancaster sands, and is formed by
the accumulated waters of the rivers, Ken
and Winster, where another guide waits to
receive the traveller.</p>

<p>The shores of the Lancaster sands fall
back to greater distance and are not so bold,
or the mountains beyond, so awful, as those
of Ulverston; but they are various, often
beautiful, and Arnside-fells have a higher
character. The town and castle of Lancaster,
on an eminence, gleaming afar off over
the level sands and backed by a dark ridge
of rocky heights, look well as you approach
them. Thither we returned and concluded
a tour, which had afforded infinite delight
in the grandeur of its landscapes and a reconciling

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 class="pgx" title="">START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
